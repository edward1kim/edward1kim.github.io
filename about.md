**Biography**  
My name is Edward Kim. The picture above is a napa cabbage I commissioned my sister to make for me. I recently graduated from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, studying Chemical Engineering. I definitely did not go down the path of my peers, instead pivoting into the world of tech. I'll be working at Capital One starting in August as a Developer Academy Associate, which is essentially a coding bootcamp. This role transitions into the 2-year Technology Development Program (TDP).

My other passion is in food. I got into cooking at the beginning of my senior year and really fell in love with it.  Then, I went and ate at Eleven Madison Park in New York City. That single meal crushed all my expectations of food and how amazing it can be. Food and cooking is truly a beautiful process, and my goal is to express that. 

I'll be posting on my personal projects, of both tech and food.
