It felt like my college experience was defined by a chase to be successful. With no experience, I was begging for any company to give me a chance. I spent more time applying to jobs and taking quick naps than paying attention…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"how we met","date":"October 21, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-10-21-how-we-met/"},"excerpt":"I met Wendi on that classic dating app. She was my first Tinder date and I was hers. We met at Starbucks on South U on a sunny, summer day in 2017. I had my friend Benny come in with me and referee the date in the background, just in case this girl was a kook. He'd come in whistle in hand and smack…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Reviews of movies I saw on the plane","date":"September 15, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-09-15-reviews-of-movies-i-saw-on-the-plane/"},"excerpt":"I was recently on a long plane ride with a pretty good selection of movies to cycle through. Good job Delta! Reviews below. Goodfellas: 9/10 I've seen this movie before and been rewatching a lot of scenes recently. I liked it even more the second time! Scorsese has a fantastic way of telling a story…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"ignorance is bliss","date":"September 12, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-09-12-ignorance-is-bliss/"},"excerpt":"I wonder if growing up means to be okay with not knowing. Maybe even prefer it. When I was a wee teenager, and this question was presented before me by a friend as we were peeling the onion, I couldn't grasp the idea of \"not knowing\". Wouldn't you want all the details to make a decisive choice? What…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"it's wrong to whore out your kid for views","date":"August 17, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-08-17-it's-wrong-to-whore-out-your-kid-for-views/"},"excerpt":"As I scroll through my Tik Tok feed, I come across these cute kids being cute. I'm talking like 3 year olds. And there's one that comes on my feed a ton; the kid's name is Grey. It's an entire account dedicated to him. But man... I think you're a bad parent if you do this to your kid. All the…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"violin teacher","date":"August 10, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-08-10-violin-teacher/"},"excerpt":"I was caught in a memory today.  I'm back in high school; I think I'm a freshman. It's almost impossible for me to place myself back at that age - either I'll think I'm too wise or too foolish. It was for the most part a normal year except for the news that a very talented violin player who I was in…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"misc updates","date":"August 01, 2021","category":["life"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/life/2021-08-01-misc-updates/"},"excerpt":"I know it's been a bit. I'm currently back in Michigan with my family for at least the next 5 months. It's nice to be home again - I went from a 95 degree and humid armpit of a state to a sweet, sweet 75. One downside of my time home is time away from my girlfriend, who is also spending the next…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"what's without the masks?","date":"June 14, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-06-14-what's-without-the-masks/"},"excerpt":"Around here in Richmond, there are more people without masks than with. I feel like the odd one out. I still think it's still very premature to go about without masks - the few failures of Fauci - but if I am to trust the experts and the scientists... it's quite nice to edge out of pandemic.  I…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"sad news","date":"June 11, 2021","category":["life"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/life/2021-06-11-sad-news/"},"excerpt":"Unfortunately, due to some circumstances, we gave our kittens back to the rescue.

Wendi made some friends who have their own cat(s), and that sparked our interest in getting our own little meows.
