And I hate the waiting game. These days, it's been a battle of how can I be productive with my time and how to get the day over with already. Most days, the latter declares victory. So here's been how I've been helping pass the time: Working. Helps that I don't know…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"sunshine face","date":"March 09, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-03-09-sunshine-face/"},"excerpt":"Recently I've been taking walks when the weather breaks. Sunshine down, sunshine on my face. My life has been severely lacking any kind of outdoor activity for the past few months; I'm surprised I took nearly daily walks after work around my neighborhood. The difference is a chasm.  I can feel my…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"today the sun shined","date":"March 07, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-03-07-today-the-sun-shined/"},"excerpt":"I was out with my dad in our back porch as he was taking a smoke break. As I stepped out and faced right towards my dad, the sun shined directly on my face - a divine light signaling the break of the pandemic or possibly a bright omen to turn back indoors towards safety. In the end, it was making me…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Web vids I saw today","date":"March 06, 2021","category":["tech"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tech/2021-03-06-web-vids-i-saw-today/"},"excerpt":"I wish I got into web develpment earlier! Or maybe now is the perfect time to learn because there is such variety out in the market. It feels like you can build a website with anything now. Why do people trash on frontend development, especially CS majors? Because it's not algorithmic enough for…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Coding as a craft","date":"March 05, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-03-05-coding-as-a-craft/"},"excerpt":"I feel extremely fortunate to be on a team with very smart and experienced engineers. I was in a programming sesh with one of my teammates, and we wandered into just our philosophy of technology. I didn't have much to say, but he said a phrase that's been stuck on my mind for a few days. \"Coding as…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Museum for me?","date":"March 05, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-03-05-museum-for-me/"},"excerpt":"The other day I was reading up on Pearl S. Buck's Wikipedia page. I have no clue how I got to this page, but I know I was on Anna May Wong's page first. She is considered the first Asian American actress in Hollywood, which I thought was not even possible in the 1920s. Skimming over her bio, I saw…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Bullet Anime Reviews","date":"March 04, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-03-04-bullet-anime-reviews/"},"excerpt":"Recently, anime has been the one thing keeping my engine running. Catching up on the hot series has been the best use of my time for the past month, especially since it looks there's there's another renaissance of anime right now. But anyway, my quick reviews... Attack on Titan Oh my GOD.

I realized I've hit an all time low of care for others a few weeks out from the presidential vote. It always felt like a us versus them scenario even if we were all Americans.

I made the mistake a year or two ago, as I was shadowing my mom cooking soondubu, that cooking Korean food seemed easy.

You can dumb down Korean cuisine quite…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"A college man's carbonara","date":"February 14, 2021","category":["food"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/food/2021-02-14-a-college-man's-carbonara/"},"excerpt":"There are countless carbonara recipes on the web, all fair and probably pointing to what an original carbonara is. The use of guanciale (cured pork jowl/cheek) is core to stay in the lane of authenticity, but I have never seen guanciale in a Kroger. And honestly with the use of super fatty pork, it…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"A moral loss","date":"February 13, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-13-a-moral-loss/"},"excerpt":"The only time I ever turned on C-SPAN (mind you it was on YouTube) was the slightest chance to see something right.

It always comes and goes, but the feeling is probably one of the worst in the world. I don't think anyone likes feeling stagnant.  I wonder if it's the sum of everything that's going on in my life, which is nothing.
