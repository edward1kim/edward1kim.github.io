However, eat steak maybe once every few months because that way it doesn't lose its novelty. Honestly, I'm getting a bit tired of meat - I can't remember the last time I craved meat. It's just part of my diet so I eat it. But do I love cooking steak. It…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Han","date":"January 29, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-29-han/"},"excerpt":"I learned at the end of 2019 about Han. My friend Chris was talking to me about it in the context of Parasite and Korean cinema, how a lot of these movies revolve around this concept of deep, hopeless sadness that's ingrained in every Korean out there. It is a shared sorrow. It is Han. That is why…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Yuck, social media","date":"January 27, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-27-yuck-social-media/"},"excerpt":"Social media is so incredibly boring these days. I think I first realized my addiction to it when I was going up the stairs mid last year and instinctively took out my phone to swipe through Instagram stories. That was quite the shocker. Later in the year, I started to purge my followers/following…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"How was my day today","date":"January 26, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-26-how-was-my-day-today/"},"excerpt":"Did you guys know I used to have a password protected Tumblr diary that I'd write in nearly every day for 4 or so years? I'd give the link and password out to friends so they could keep up. I stopped that maybe my sophomore year of college. It was definitely one of my most dedicated pastimes…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Good News I was Talking About","date":"January 25, 2021","category":["life"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/life/2021-01-25-the-good-news-i-was-talking-about/"},"excerpt":"I got promoted!

In my senior year of college, I'd post up little phrases like \"Have Grit\" and \"Do More\" on index cards above my desk and rarely look at them after. Remember that? Sort of cringey because I'm not a big fan of all that Inspirational Lifestyle…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Finally finished with this site rehaul","date":"January 23, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-23-finally-finished-with-this-site-rehaul/"},"excerpt":"It took me about a week of on and off working to learn the React framework Gatsby, adjust all my posts which are in markdown, reset image paths for the posts that do have images, rewrite some logic, and style.

I've basically copied the same style…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Crazy food ideas","date":"January 15, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-15-crazy-food-ideas/"},"excerpt":"Here are three of my craziest, mostly unattempted food ideas: Gochujang spaghetti Gochujang and honey jam Carmelized onion and brown butter cookies"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"A pledge to donate","date":"January 13, 2021","category":["life"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/life/2021-01-13-donation-pledge/"},"excerpt":"I was a chubby kid. When I look back at photos when I was 2 to 5 years old, I'm usually mid-chew or holding something half eaten. Food was my friend! And other people let me know that food was my friend, comments about my size, my rolls, my chins, all that. I don't think I ever registered what that…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Why name a candle ocean mist when the ocean almost killed me","date":"January 10, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-09-ocean-panic/"},"excerpt":"One of my favorite places in the world is Hawaii. If I had unlimited riches, I'd spend quarter of my year there, a quarter in Korea, a quarter in Japan, and the final quarter in Michigan (or wherever my family is).

But then you say one and a half hourS! That's less than 2, so I adjust my definition to a count of greater than one. Okay, that makes sense: 1.1 hours, 1.25 hours, 1.0000001 hours.

What about 0.5 (zero…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Preschool Presidential Pictures","date":"January 06, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-06-preschool-presidential-pictures/"},"excerpt":"When I was in preschool, I remember there was a whole banner of every president up til 2001. I remember just looking at these white men, wondering why it went from a portrait to real photos. I remember how wrinkly George H. W. Bush looked relative to Bill Clinton or JFK. This banner spanned the…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Reminder to the world that I was an Avatar fan before you","date":"January 04, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-04-reminder-to-the-world/"},"excerpt":"Everyone got on that Avatar: The Last Airbender wagon this past year ever since Netflix decided to put the series (back) on the platform.

More memes spread around, the r/atla subreddit was more active…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Dream Review: A Joke I Wish I Remembered","date":"January 02, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-02-dream-review/"},"excerpt":"Last night, I made the best joke/comment/line/lyric in my dream that surpassed all other jokes in dreams in existence.
