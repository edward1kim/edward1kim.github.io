I keep my birthday pretty low key because I like spending my birthday like most other days, ending with a quick celebration with family. But every year, my friends still remember even after I tried to erase its existence from the web…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"FAQ","date":"February 04, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-04-faq/"},"excerpt":"I've always wanted to do a Ask Me Anything, like the ones you see on reddit or YouTube, probably because I wanted to be famous. I'm sort of an attention whore, and my ego has not been fed in a while. So let me pretend that I'm famous for this moment, like I'll write a memoir one day, like I've…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"covid","date":"February 01, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-01-covid/"},"excerpt":"I have to remind myself often that this is a pandemic. Millions of people have died and there are still people that are incredibly irresponsible roaming without masks. I have to remind myself not to trust anyone, for the sake of my family, because friends can be asymptomatic. Exceptions lead to…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"I LIKE SOGGY BREAD","date":"February 01, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-01-i-like-soggy-bread/"},"excerpt":"I said it. And I wonder if anyone else agrees with me. Let me explain what I really mean though - I don't mean bread dipped in water by the way. That's so gross. I'm talking about the last bits of bread from a sandwich or burger, soaked in all the oils, fats, condiments, maybe the last bits of…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Learning Something New","date":"January 31, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-31-learning-something-new/"},"excerpt":"This past Friday, I got placed into a new team in my rotational program.

However, eat steak maybe once every few months because that way it doesn't lose its novelty. Honestly, I'm getting a bit tired of meat - I can't remember the last time I craved meat. It's just part of my diet so I eat it. But do I love cooking steak. It…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Han","date":"January 29, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-29-han/"},"excerpt":"I learned at the end of 2019 about Han. My friend Chris was talking to me about it in the context of Parasite and Korean cinema, how a lot of these movies revolve around this concept of deep, hopeless sadness that's ingrained in every Korean out there. It is a shared sorrow. It is Han. That is why…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Yuck, social media","date":"January 27, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-27-yuck-social-media/"},"excerpt":"Social media is so incredibly boring these days. I think I first realized my addiction to it when I was going up the stairs mid last year and instinctively took out my phone to swipe through Instagram stories. That was quite the shocker. Later in the year, I started to purge my followers/following…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"How was my day today","date":"January 26, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-26-how-was-my-day-today/"},"excerpt":"Did you guys know I used to have a password protected Tumblr diary that I'd write in nearly every day for 4 or so years? I'd give the link and password out to friends so they could keep up. I stopped that maybe my sophomore year of college. It was definitely one of my most dedicated pastimes…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Good News I was Talking About","date":"January 25, 2021","category":["life"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/life/2021-01-25-the-good-news-i-was-talking-about/"},"excerpt":"I got promoted!

In my senior year of college, I'd post up little phrases like \"Have Grit\" and \"Do More\" on index cards above my desk and rarely look at them after. Remember that?

When I look back at photos when I was 2 to 5 years old, I'm usually mid-chew or holding something half eaten. Food was my friend! And other people let me know that food was my friend, comments about my size, my rolls, my chins, all that.
