I don't think I've ever had a story make me laugh and gasp in a span of a sentence. It is a fun book to read, and it felt like a fever dream at times, with an excess of detail and the author's use of magical realism. The prose is just so…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"My Top Moments of 2020 and Takeaways","date":"December 31, 2020","category":["life"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/life/2020-12-31-top-moments-of-2020/"},"excerpt":"Only got a few this year due to you-know-what. 7.

I want to operate a bootleg restaurant out of my house, known through word of mouth and would cost enough to cover groceries and a dessert for my team. It'll be my way of flexing my cooking prowess and creativity. Somewhat along the same…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Hot takes, please click","date":"December 29, 2020","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2020-12-29-hot-takes-here/"},"excerpt":"Hot off the press and grill. 1. Beef wellington is over-the-top and has little payoff I have not made a beef wellington before. I have looked into it, but in high school, I was not going to lay out muchos dollars for a filet mignon, which is in my opinion a lackluster piece of meat. I've tossed the…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"My Spending Trends","date":"December 28, 2020","category":["life"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/life/2020-12-28-my-spending-trends/"},"excerpt":"Before I started working, I set up a whole Google Sheet to help organize all my financials.

Usually, I'm very comfortable with myself that I can wrestle with any jealousies. Usually, if I wanted to do something, I can do it. There would be no \"missing out\" - usually. But it's getting harder and harder to find that inner peace in the pandemic, as I hear about this…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"My Observation on Foodtubers","date":"December 26, 2020","category":["food"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/food/2020-12-26-my-observation-on-foodtubers/"},"excerpt":"My foodtuber-watching journey started with Epic Meal Time. Just absolute carnage of a show, especially in the wild, unruly days of YouTube. I think they might have coined the Turducken. Pretty disgusting to be honest, but that was their whole image. Indulgence. I wasn't into food or cooking then…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"My Short Thoughts on Yoga From My Short Experience with Yoga","date":"December 25, 2020","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2020-12-25-my-short-thoughts-on-yoga-from-my-short-experience-with-yoga/"},"excerpt":"Near the end of November, I started doing yoga at home with this Yoga with Adriene's 30 Days of Yoga.

Kenji Lopez-Alt will come up once or twice or many many times. When he was posting his first-person Youtube videos, I would cook alongside him. These videos would determine what I ate for the week.  As a result of his job and…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Best Feeling","date":"December 23, 2020","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2020-12-23-the-best-feeling/"},"excerpt":"One of the best feelings in the world is the nostalgia of food. It is comfort. I can't say my experience is exactly like Ego's when he took a bite of Remy's ratatouille, but I experienced something similar a few Saturdays ago. My mom cooked this one stew made with beef, potatoes, tofu, and ddengjang…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"What has changed?","date":"December 17, 2020","category":["life"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/life/2020-12-17-what-has-changed/"},"excerpt":"It has been more than an entire year since I last posted!
