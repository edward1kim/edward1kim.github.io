If I had unlimited riches, I'd spend quarter of my year there, a quarter in Korea, a quarter in Japan, and the final quarter in Michigan (or wherever my family is). Funny enough, despite all the good memories on several of the islands, I hate the…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Plural Conundrum","date":"January 07, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-07-plural-conundrum/"},"excerpt":"When you say \"hours\", that means at least 2 hours - 1 hour, 2 hours. But then you say one and a half hourS! That's less than 2, so I adjust my definition to a count of greater than one. Okay, that makes sense: 1.1 hours, 1.25 hours, 1.0000001 hours.

I remember just looking at these white men, wondering why it went from a portrait to real photos. I remember how wrinkly George H. W. Bush looked relative to Bill Clinton or JFK. This banner spanned the…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Reminder to the world that I was an Avatar fan before you","date":"January 04, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-04-reminder-to-the-world/"},"excerpt":"Everyone got on that Avatar: The Last Airbender wagon this past year ever since Netflix decided to put the series (back) on the platform. And if I can make a not-so-absurd claim with no proof, I think 2020 was the year for social media. More memes spread around, the r/atla subreddit was more active…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Dream Review: A Joke I Wish I Remembered","date":"January 02, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-02-dream-review/"},"excerpt":"Last night, I made the best joke/comment/line/lyric in my dream that surpassed all other jokes in dreams in existence. My laughter escaped from unreality to actual audibility out of my dry mouth at 7 AM. It was like that dream when I was 5 where my mom was the pink Power Ranger and was fighting off…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: A Hundred Years of Solitude","date":"January 01, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-01-a-hundred-years-of-solitude-review/"},"excerpt":"I just finished this book and am left emotionally exhausted. I don't think I've ever had a story make me laugh and gasp in a span of a sentence. It is a fun book to read, and it felt like a fever dream at times, with an excess of detail and the author's use of magical realism. The prose is just so…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"New Bucket List Items","date":"December 30, 2020","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2020-12-30-new-bucket-list-items/"},"excerpt":"Recently, I've added some new life goals/bucket list items.  I want to operate a bootleg restaurant out of my house, known through word of mouth and would cost enough to cover groceries and a dessert for my team. It'll be my way of flexing my cooking prowess and creativity.

Beef wellington is over-the-top and has little payoff I have not made a beef wellington before. I have looked into it, but in high school, I was not going to lay out muchos dollars for a filet mignon, which is in my opinion a lackluster piece of meat.

Usually, I'm very comfortable with myself that I can wrestle with any jealousies. Usually, if I wanted to do something, I can do it. There would be no \"missing out\" - usually.
