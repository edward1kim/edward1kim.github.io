How can someone so abhorrent be allowed to assume the most important position in America and then do everything wrong? As I wrestle more with my political leanings, I can understand…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The cure for boredom","date":"February 11, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-11-the-cure-for-boredom/"},"excerpt":"I'm in one of those periods of boredom. It always comes and goes, but the feeling is probably one of the worst in the world. I don't think anyone likes feeling stagnant.  I wonder if it's the sum of everything that's going on in my life, which is nothing. I don't have much to look forward to, no new…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Favorites 1","date":"February 07, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-07-favorites-1/"},"excerpt":"One of my favorite scenes in cinema is from Inglourious Basterds. https://youtu.be/RBobeT9cXK4. This scene describes the introduction of the basterds, who only play a sideline role in my opinion despite the movie's titles, but they are by far the most entertaining groups with some absolute fantastic…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Pagination Problem","date":"February 05, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-05-pagination-problem/"},"excerpt":"I have to say... I'm pretty happy with how this website looks! It was a lot of finnicky styling, copying and pasting and crossing my fingers that it'll work. I am especially proud of how the navbar items glow when your mouse hovers over it and same things when hovering over the posts on the page. I…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"FAQ","date":"February 04, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-04-faq/"},"excerpt":"I've always wanted to do a Ask Me Anything, like the ones you see on reddit or YouTube, probably because I wanted to be famous. I'm sort of an attention whore, and my ego has not been fed in a while. So let me pretend that I'm famous for this moment, like I'll write a memoir one day, like I've…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"I LIKE SOGGY BREAD","date":"February 01, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-01-i-like-soggy-bread/"},"excerpt":"I said it. And I wonder if anyone else agrees with me. Let me explain what I really mean though - I don't mean bread dipped in water by the way. That's so gross. I'm talking about the last bits of bread from a sandwich or burger, soaked in all the oils, fats, condiments, maybe the last bits of…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"covid","date":"February 01, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-01-covid/"},"excerpt":"I have to remind myself often that this is a pandemic. Millions of people have died and there are still people that are incredibly irresponsible roaming without masks. I have to remind myself not to trust anyone, for the sake of my family, because friends can be asymptomatic. Exceptions lead to…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Learning Something New","date":"January 31, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-31-learning-something-new/"},"excerpt":"This past Friday, I got placed into a new team in my rotational program. I'm going to spend the next month transitioning, tying up any loose ends on my team right now and onboard to the next. I just messaged my new manager a bit back and forth, thinking I'd be working on some already made…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Best steak","date":"January 30, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-30-best-steak/"},"excerpt":"The best way to cook a steak is reverse sear. However, eat steak maybe once every few months because that way it doesn't lose its novelty. Honestly, I'm getting a bit tired of meat - I can't remember the last time I craved meat. It's just part of my diet so I eat it. But do I love cooking steak. It…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Han","date":"January 29, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-29-han/"},"excerpt":"I learned at the end of 2019 about Han. My friend Chris was talking to me about it in the context of Parasite and Korean cinema, how a lot of these movies revolve around this concept of deep, hopeless sadness that's ingrained in every Korean out there. It is a shared sorrow. It is Han. That is why…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Yuck, social media","date":"January 27, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-27-yuck-social-media/"},"excerpt":"Social media is so incredibly boring these days. I think I first realized my addiction to it when I was going up the stairs mid last year and instinctively took out my phone to swipe through Instagram stories. That was quite the shocker. Later in the year, I started to purge my followers/following…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"How was my day today","date":"January 26, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-26-how-was-my-day-today/"},"excerpt":"Did you guys know I used to have a password protected Tumblr diary that I'd write in nearly every day for 4 or so years? I'd give the link and password out to friends so they could keep up. I stopped that maybe my sophomore year of college. It was definitely one of my most dedicated pastimes…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Letter to me 1","date":"January 24, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-24-letter-to-me-1/"},"excerpt":"Dear Me,  I've always wanted to write to myself, formally. In my senior year of college, I'd post up little phrases like \"Have Grit\" and \"Do More\" on index cards above my desk and rarely look at them after. Remember that? Sort of cringey because I'm not a big fan of all that Inspirational Lifestyle…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Finally finished with this site rehaul","date":"January 23, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-23-finally-finished-with-this-site-rehaul/"},"excerpt":"It took me about a week of on and off working to learn the React framework Gatsby, adjust all my posts which are in markdown, reset image paths for the posts that do have images, rewrite some logic, and style.
