This time there will be no consequences. </p>\n<p>Because the world is over and humanity is done. </p>\n<p>But it's just our luck that our greatest minds forgot to carry quite a few ones and misinformed the public that the end of the world is today - this instant - and not billions of years in the forgotten future. I wonder if they're also looking right at the sun and wishing they spent more time with their kids than some imaginary numbers. </p>\n<p>But back to me, the one facing an exploding star. I read a book recently about a woman that took care of her cancer-strucken mom, all the way til the end. It is a beautiful story in describing the many stages of grief, and the first part of that tough journey starts the moment a loved one faces the idea that death is coming. For the girl in this story, it was a phone call of a recent doctor's visit. One mild difference between me and this girl is that the next few seconds, there won't be anyone to mourn me, to feel like I'm slowly fading to another side. It's an easy flip of a page.</p>\n<p>I keep switching between turning my brain off to accept the reality of the next few seconds and logging my memoir - my best memories - in the moment I have to spare. There's no point to either, yet I linger a little longer on the latter. I want to remember my family vacation to Hawaii; I want to remember the laughs and drinks on a random Friday during university. I want to keep the day my girlfriend became my girlfriend as close to my heart until the air gets too hot to breathe.</p>\n<p>I'm freaking out. Did I make a mistake facing my end so clearly, to flash my life before my eyes like all the movies have warned? I've stopped looking at the sun at this point, and I'm running to find someone. Someone. The world is ending and I cannot believe it.</p>\n<p>Is this the end?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"is this the end?","date":"October 29, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-10-29-is-this-the-end/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
