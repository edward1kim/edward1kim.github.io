Millions of people have died and there are still people that are incredibly irresponsible roaming without masks. I have to remind myself not to trust anyone, for the sake of my family, because friends can be asymptomatic. Exceptions lead to cracks, and cracks only grow wider. </p>\n<p>It feels inevitable to get covid. And once I get covid, I'll spread it to my parents, or vice versa. And maybe one of us will die. A lot of days, it's like a ticking time bomb. </p>\n<p>My first relief will be when my parents get vaccinated. My second is when the pandemic is officially over. </p>\n<p>It upsets me to know that people I hate so much like Mike Pence and Mitch McConnell got the vaccine (albeit they're rather old). I just can't comprehend why their lives are worth more than my mom or dad when they've done so much evil to America. And I really think politics now is more of a moral problem - meaning there is a clear right and wrong, good and evil - than true politics. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"covid","date":"February 01, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-01-covid/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
