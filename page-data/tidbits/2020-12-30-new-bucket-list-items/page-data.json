It'll be my way of flexing my cooking prowess and creativity.</li>\n<li>Somewhat along the same lines, I want to organize a food retreat with some serious home cooks and dedicate 3 days to experimenting, cooking exotic/expensive ingredients, discussing, eating, drinking cocktails, and finally pull off a 5 course meal for friends/ourselves. Sort of like what El Bulli did when it was still running.</li>\n<li>Lastly, I want a nearly self-sustained dining experience, meaning I want all plates/bowls made by me, my table and anything wooden by me, all food cooked by me. I always admired that Tyler, The Creator wrote, produced, and arranged every one of his albums, and this goal is my homage to him. </li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"New Bucket List Items","date":"December 30, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2020-12-30-new-bucket-list-items/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
