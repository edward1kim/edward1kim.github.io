Maybe even prefer it. When I was a wee teenager, and this question was presented before me by a friend as we were peeling the onion, I couldn't grasp the idea of \"not knowing\". Wouldn't you want all the details to make a decisive choice? What if this one thing you don't know was the key to everything? I was thinking methodically. Don't leave room for assumptions if you don't have to. </p>\n<p>But as I'm feeling out life more, it isn't a puzzle where one piece will always connect with another. I'm almost more happy to know just enough to not get upset or have to make a choice. Because truth beyond childhood is lots of loss and acceptance of loss. I fortunately haven't had to deal with the death of someone important to me. I'm dealing with loss of respect for people around me and society as a whole at the moment - it's very relevant to the pandemic. Maybe I'm finding myself again? </p>\n<p>\"The more you know, the more you realize how much you don't know.\" So please give me just enough to still have hope in the future. Please!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ignorance is bliss","date":"September 12, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-09-12-ignorance-is-bliss/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
