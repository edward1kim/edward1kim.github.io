I don't think I've ever had a story make me laugh and gasp in a span of a sentence. It is a fun book to read, and it felt like a fever dream at times, with an excess of detail and the author's use of magical realism. The prose is just so beautiful, and what's even more amazing is that it was originally written in Spanish! I was wondering throughout my read how this would be felt in its intended tongue, jealous that my forgotten high school Spanish would not suffice. It is a story of generations of Buend√≠a's, with names spelled out to length and lovable in every respect - even the ones that you're supposed to hate.</p>\n<p>This may be the best book I've ever read, and I can't wait to stay up late reading up on analyses and eventually start from page 1 for another century of Macondo.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: A Hundred Years of Solitude","date":"January 01, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-01-a-hundred-years-of-solitude-review/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842"]}
