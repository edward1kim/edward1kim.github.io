Usually, I'm very comfortable with myself that I can wrestle with any jealousies. Usually, if I wanted to do something, I can do it. There would be no \"missing out\" - usually. But it's getting harder and harder to find that inner peace in the pandemic, as I hear about this person and that person going somewhere more exciting, and I'm home, very bored. If my goal is comfort, then boredom will be my greatest foe. </p>\n<p>When there's nothing going on, I'll want something to do, but when there's too much going on, I'll want to do nothing. I'm pretty sure this was a core theme of Candide.</p>\n<p>So I wonder if I'm one to risk travel during a pandemic, to give up comfort for adventure, see if the experiences I think I'm missing will fulfill me more than my everyday. Maybe this dilemma is what's making me ween off social media. I can't take another influencer posting about their negative test results like that email justifies their license for fun.</p>\n<p>I'm not really sure what I'm saying. I'm on PTO until the first Monday of 2021 and I have no clue how I'll spend the next 7 days. I'm missing the homies, the gym, restaurants, spontaneous trips, planned trips, reunions, haircuts where they don't miss a few hairs around my mask straps. I've been to NYC 3 times already this year and all I've wanted was to leave right away. One thing I'll forever hate no matter what is the actual traveling. I dislike being at airports, waiting, the anxiety of missing another flight in my life, sitting in a seat for hours. That will never be fun.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"FOMO in Pandemic","date":"December 27, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2020-12-27-fomo-in-pandemic/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842"]}
