This time there will be no consequences.  Because the world is over and humanity is done.  But it's just our luck that our greatest minds forgot to carry quite a few ones and misinformed the public that the end of the world is today - this instant…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"how we met","date":"October 21, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-10-21-how-we-met/"},"excerpt":"I met Wendi on that classic dating app. She was my first Tinder date and I was hers. We met at Starbucks on South U on a sunny, summer day in 2017. I had my friend Benny come in with me and referee the date in the background, just in case this girl was a kook. He'd come in whistle in hand and smack…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Reviews of movies I saw on the plane","date":"September 15, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-09-15-reviews-of-movies-i-saw-on-the-plane/"},"excerpt":"I was recently on a long plane ride with a pretty good selection of movies to cycle through. Good job Delta! Reviews below. Goodfellas: 9/10 I've seen this movie before and been rewatching a lot of scenes recently. I liked it even more the second time!

Maybe even prefer it. When I was a wee teenager, and this question was presented before me by a friend as we were peeling the onion, I couldn't grasp the idea of \"not knowing\". Wouldn't you want all the details to make a decisive choice? What…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"it's wrong to whore out your kid for views","date":"August 17, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-08-17-it's-wrong-to-whore-out-your-kid-for-views/"},"excerpt":"As I scroll through my Tik Tok feed, I come across these cute kids being cute. I'm talking like 3 year olds. And there's one that comes on my feed a ton; the kid's name is Grey. It's an entire account dedicated to him. But man... I think you're a bad parent if you do this to your kid. All the…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"violin teacher","date":"August 10, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-08-10-violin-teacher/"},"excerpt":"I was caught in a memory today.  I'm back in high school; I think I'm a freshman. It's almost impossible for me to place myself back at that age - either I'll think I'm too wise or too foolish. It was for the most part a normal year except for the news that a very talented violin player who I was in…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"long ass week","date":"May 22, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-05-22-long-ass-week/"},"excerpt":"It's only been a week of having the 3 meows and I am quite exhausted almost on every front. I think I've been getting anxiety from the life change. I'm glad I have Wendi to talk it through. I wonder if it's normal to feel this.  I feel unprepared. Inadequate?

I've been doing a short run every few days around the lake in my neighborhood. Each lap around it is almost exactly half a mile, which makes tracking and bearing through the run easier.

It's a very short moment, right when the grandma comes to the family from Korea. In her suitcase, she brings back all these Korean spices, anchovies, herbs, the whole ordeal.

It made me think why I cook…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Movie Review: Minari","date":"April 25, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-04-25-movie-review:-minari/"},"excerpt":"6/10.  I thought the film's strengths were in the characters. A lot of the dialogue exchanged between the parents really struck me emotionally because the intonation and language reminded me of my parents.

I think the fact that it was about Hitler turned me off for so long, but his persistence was admirable and I wish I watched this sooner. Jojo Rabbit is what I consider the perfect movie. The cinematography…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"project updates","date":"April 22, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-04-22-project-updates/"},"excerpt":"I've been occupied with a few different projects this past month.
