However, eat steak maybe once every few months because that way it doesn't lose its novelty. Honestly, I'm getting a bit tired of meat - I can't remember the last time I craved meat. It's just part of my diet so I eat it. But do I love cooking steak. It…"}},{"node":{"id":"f2e143b3-197c-57c3-94a3-2109a39b0e2b","frontmatter":{"title":"Han","date":"January 29, 2021","category":"tidbits","isHead":null},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-29-han/"},"excerpt":"I learned at the end of 2019 about Han. My friend Chris was talking to me about it in the context of Parasite and Korean cinema, how a lot of these movies revolve around this concept of deep, hopeless sadness that's ingrained in every Korean out there. It is a shared sorrow. It is Han.

I think I first realized my addiction to it when I was going up the stairs mid last year and instinctively took out my phone to swipe through Instagram stories. That was quite the shocker. Later in the year, I started to purge my followers/following…"}},{"node":{"id":"0f49d217-1d69-538d-8bb3-b7ae0054166d","frontmatter":{"title":"How was my day today","date":"January 26, 2021","category":"tidbits","isHead":null},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-26-how-was-my-day-today/"},"excerpt":"Did you guys know I used to have a password protected Tumblr diary that I'd write in nearly every day for 4 or so years?
