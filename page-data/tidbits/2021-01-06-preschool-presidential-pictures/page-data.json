I remember just looking at these white men, wondering why it went from a portrait to real photos. I remember how wrinkly George H. W. Bush looked relative to Bill Clinton or JFK. This banner spanned the entire length of the classroom wall; to a 4 year old, it looked like there were hundreds of presidents. I was disappointed that there were only 43 presidents then. </p>\n<p>My teachers would point out how grand and important every one of these men were, how George Washington was the first to call dibs and that's how he became Mr. Prez, or how Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and I had no idea what slaves were so that didn't really hit as much as the teacher thought, or our current president (at the time) George W. Bush who had the same name as another president - possibly his only fun fact and the other details of his term are quite sour. Their active years were listed right under their picture - we all got to count if it was 4 or 8 years in between - and it was like a weird family lineage, which to an Asian kid with 40-some white men in front of him, that made sense! </p>\n<p>Presidents meant something back then, or it seemed like it. There was a respect that the teacher gave to president. For some reason, I thought that it was like a beauty pageant where each state would send over a single man to become president. America would vote by calling in and boom, there's your next president. Teacher would say, \"Hey, that could be you one day.\" And you say, \"I am pretty enough I guess. Presidential.\"</p>\n<p>I wonder if teachers are still pointing at a person like Donald Trump and saying the same things. You can be like him one day, if you cheat, lie, murder... You can be president too if you're racist, sexist, and unite the worst of the worst.</p>\n<p>Today was pure bile. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Preschool Presidential Pictures","date":"January 06, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-06-preschool-presidential-pictures/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
