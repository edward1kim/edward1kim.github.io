Kenji Lopez-Alt</a> will come up once or twice or many many times. When he was posting his first-person Youtube videos, I would cook alongside him. These videos would determine what I ate for the week. </p>\n<p>As a result of his job and being in the food industry, he has some beautiful kitchen items, one of them being <a href=\"https://www.earlywooddesigns.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Earlywood</a> spatulas. There's just something so special about wooden items. Even though it takes more care compared to its silicon/plastic counterpart, there's an attachment that's built with oiling every nook and cranny, smoothing the grain... It almost glows after. </p>\n<p>I wish I could remember Kenji's exact words about these spatulas and anything beyond, but I'll try my best to paraphase:</p>\n<p>\"I believe that you enjoy cooking <em>more</em> when you enjoy the things you're cooking with.\"</p>\n<p>Something like that. This can be taken outside of cooking too. I'd never advise a novice in any hobby/activity to get the highest end of anything, but I do promote the idea of appreciating handmade things, recognizing the difference from one and another, and getting attached to your stuff. It's part of the fun anyway.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Enjoy What You Have","date":"December 24, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2020-12-24-enjoy-what-you-have/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842"]}
