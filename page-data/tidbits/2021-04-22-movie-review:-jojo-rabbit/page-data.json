I think the fact that it was about Hitler turned me off for so long, but his persistence was admirable and I wish I watched this sooner.</p>\n<p>Jojo Rabbit is what I consider the perfect movie. The cinematography, soundtrack, the story, the characters... THE CHARACTERS! I have such love for them all, and the witty writing brings out the human-ness of everyone despite the crumbling of Germany at the precipice of WWII. </p>\n<p>I will pass on the spirit of my persistent friend by encouraging the world to watch this movie if you haven't already. I have an illegal site that another friend who's a pro Googler showed me. I can link it to you there.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Movie Review: Jojo Rabbit","date":"April 22, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-04-22-movie-review:-jojo-rabbit/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
