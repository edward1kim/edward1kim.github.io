And I hate the waiting game. These days, it's been a battle of how can I be productive with my time and how to get the day over with already. Most days, the latter declares victory. So here's been how I've been helping pass the time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working. Helps that I don't know anything on my new team, so time actually goes by pretty quickly.</li>\n<li>Forcing my mom or dad (whoever is home) to go on a neighborly walk, even for 10 or 15 minutes.</li>\n<li>Cooking dinner before my parents come home. They have standards and I feel like a failure if I don't meet them. Nothing shall be overcooked nor unprepared at the table!</li>\n<li>Watching anime. Quite a bit of anime... The stuff out right now is absolutely amazing. </li>\n<li>Youtube as usual. Recently it's been watching Curb Your Enthusiasm clips. Last week was Parks &#x26; Rec.</li>\n<li>Being in my own head. I feel like I have all these thoughts that just pass through my mind, but I don't actually process it. I remember I was taking my lunch break in the middle of a bug fix, and I could feel my mind still processing and working as I was taking bites of rice. I've recently been thinking about why pinky toes are more like thumbs than pinky fingers. Like what did pinky toes do in humankind's genetic epic to deserve one less bend? </li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"what's been helping pass the time","date":"March 14, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-03-14-what's-been-helping-pass-the-time/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
