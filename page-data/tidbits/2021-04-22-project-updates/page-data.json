I will give my initial thoughts and impressions of said projects:</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Recipe Book</strong></p>\n<p>As said in a previous post, I started recipe book! I have around 30 recipes listed with a majority filled out. My goal is to get all of those recipes filled by the end of April, do a week to review over those recipes, share the doc with some friends to proofread, and then add more recipes! </p>\n<p>I've gone for a pretty straightforward format split into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Title</li>\n<li>Difficulty out of 5</li>\n<li>Special Equipment, if any</li>\n<li>Description/Story</li>\n<li>Ingredients</li>\n<li>Instructions</li>\n<li>Notes</li>\n<li>References</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've been trying to group ingredients to parts of a recipe if applicable. For example, doejang jigae can be split to <em>spices and base</em>, <em>meat and vegetables</em>, and <em>finishers</em>. This is to cut time your eyes would wander to find a specific portion of a recipe.</p>\n<p>I've also added a References section because none of these recipes are really mine... They're a collection of all the different research and recipes I've also viewed. I'm sure most of them are 90% similar to what I've referenced. </p>\n<p>The link is in a previous post if you want to take a peek.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Sub Irrigated Planter</strong></p>\n<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mRhLZM-cJZ0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Internet Shaquille's video</a>, I finally acquired all the supplies to make them, starting with three variety of tomatoes. I planted a four seeds per planter, but I'm not sure if they will germinate... If they don't, I'm just going to buy saplings later. Not much updates here, just a waiting game.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Homemade Doenjang</strong></p>\n<p>Once my heated pad came in, I can finally start making this. It'll be a yearlong project, starting this Saturday. No updates yet, but I hope nothing bad happens. Please no flies or black mold!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"project updates","date":"April 22, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-04-22-project-updates/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
