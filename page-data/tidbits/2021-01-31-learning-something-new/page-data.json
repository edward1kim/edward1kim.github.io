I'm going to spend the next month transitioning, tying up any loose ends on my team right now and onboard to the next. I just messaged my new manager a bit back and forth, thinking I'd be working on some already made microservices coded in Python and Go, but to my surprise, he suggested I start learning .NET Core and the Entity Framework. What?</p>\n<p>So after my anime binge this weekend, I am scrambling to understand C#, how all this .NET stuff works. I know I still have time, but I don't really know where to start. I feel like I've been spoiled by these high level, non-typed, non-compiled languages. I love how Python reads like broken English, I love how you never have to really deal with classes, and if you do, they're simple and sweet in syntax. I love not thinking. </p>\n<p>But I guess techies are so insistent on OOP and using odd words like <code>namespace</code> or <code>public</code> vs <code>private</code> or <code>bool</code> (I'm exaggerating a bit here to the fools that don't know). Bool. To the everyday person, that means to chill, have a beer - don't forget. </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Here is my hacked plan for learning everything for my new team</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Neglect my current team because I'm off to bigger and better things</li>\n<li>Learn the basics of C# and play around with what compiles and what doesn't</li>\n<li>Go through .NET tutorials</li>\n<li>Half-listen to .NET videos at 1.25-1.5x speed</li>\n<li>Learn Docker</li>\n<li>Learn how to deploy a .NET app</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So far, I've watched a 10 minute video on C# syntax and I already feel overwhelmed. Oh well. If I get this, maybe this is my key into Microsoft. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Learning Something New","date":"January 31, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-31-learning-something-new/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
