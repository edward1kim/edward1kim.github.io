I think I first realized my addiction to it when I was going up the stairs mid last year and instinctively took out my phone to swipe through Instagram stories. That was quite the shocker. Later in the year, I started to purge my followers/following…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"How was my day today","date":"January 26, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-26-how-was-my-day-today/"},"excerpt":"Did you guys know I used to have a password protected Tumblr diary that I'd write in nearly every day for 4 or so years? I'd give the link and password out to friends so they could keep up. I stopped that maybe my sophomore year of college. It was definitely one of my most dedicated pastimes…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Letter to me 1","date":"January 24, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-24-letter-to-me-1/"},"excerpt":"Dear Me,  I've always wanted to write to myself, formally. In my senior year of college, I'd post up little phrases like \"Have Grit\" and \"Do More\" on index cards above my desk and rarely look at them after. Remember that? Sort of cringey because I'm not a big fan of all that Inspirational Lifestyle…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Finally finished with this site rehaul","date":"January 23, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-23-finally-finished-with-this-site-rehaul/"},"excerpt":"It took me about a week of on and off working to learn the React framework Gatsby, adjust all my posts which are in markdown, reset image paths for the posts that do have images, rewrite some logic, and style. My first real project outside of work after college! I've basically copied the same style…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Crazy food ideas","date":"January 15, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-15-crazy-food-ideas/"},"excerpt":"Here are three of my craziest, mostly unattempted food ideas: Gochujang spaghetti Gochujang and honey jam Carmelized onion and brown butter cookies"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Why name a candle ocean mist when the ocean almost killed me","date":"January 10, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-09-ocean-panic/"},"excerpt":"One of my favorite places in the world is Hawaii. If I had unlimited riches, I'd spend quarter of my year there, a quarter in Korea, a quarter in Japan, and the final quarter in Michigan (or wherever my family is). Funny enough, despite all the good memories on several of the islands, I hate the…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Plural Conundrum","date":"January 07, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-07-plural-conundrum/"},"excerpt":"When you say \"hours\", that means at least 2 hours - 1 hour, 2 hours. But then you say one and a half hourS! That's less than 2, so I adjust my definition to a count of greater than one. Okay, that makes sense: 1.1 hours, 1.25 hours, 1.0000001 hours.

What about 0.5 (zero…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Preschool Presidential Pictures","date":"January 06, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-06-preschool-presidential-pictures/"},"excerpt":"When I was in preschool, I remember there was a whole banner of every president up til 2001. I remember just looking at these white men, wondering why it went from a portrait to real photos. I remember how wrinkly George H. W. Bush looked relative to Bill Clinton or JFK. This banner spanned the…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Reminder to the world that I was an Avatar fan before you","date":"January 04, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-04-reminder-to-the-world/"},"excerpt":"Everyone got on that Avatar: The Last Airbender wagon this past year ever since Netflix decided to put the series (back) on the platform. And if I can make a not-so-absurd claim with no proof, I think 2020 was the year for social media. More memes spread around, the r/atla subreddit was more active…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Dream Review: A Joke I Wish I Remembered","date":"January 02, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-02-dream-review/"},"excerpt":"Last night, I made the best joke/comment/line/lyric in my dream that surpassed all other jokes in dreams in existence.

I don't think I've ever had a story make me laugh and gasp in a span of a sentence. It is a fun book to read, and it felt like a fever dream at times, with an excess of detail and the author's use of magical realism. The prose is just so…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"New Bucket List Items","date":"December 30, 2020","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2020-12-30-new-bucket-list-items/"},"excerpt":"Recently, I've added some new life goals/bucket list items.  I want to operate a bootleg restaurant out of my house, known through word of mouth and would cost enough to cover groceries and a dessert for my team. It'll be my way of flexing my cooking prowess and creativity. Somewhat along the same…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Hot takes, please click","date":"December 29, 2020","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2020-12-29-hot-takes-here/"},"excerpt":"Hot off the press and grill. 1. Beef wellington is over-the-top and has little payoff I have not made a beef wellington before. I have looked into it, but in high school, I was not going to lay out muchos dollars for a filet mignon, which is in my opinion a lackluster piece of meat.

Usually, I'm very comfortable with myself that I can wrestle with any jealousies. Usually, if I wanted to do something, I can do it. There would be no \"missing out\" - usually. But it's getting harder and harder to find that inner peace in the pandemic, as I hear about this…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"My Short Thoughts on Yoga From My Short Experience with Yoga","date":"December 25, 2020","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2020-12-25-my-short-thoughts-on-yoga-from-my-short-experience-with-yoga/"},"excerpt":"Near the end of November, I started doing yoga at home with this Yoga with Adriene's 30 Days of Yoga.
