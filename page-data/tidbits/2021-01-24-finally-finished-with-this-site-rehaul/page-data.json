My first real project outside of work after college! I've basically copied the same style as my old theme, but I plan on changing things up in the future as I start to look for my own look and style. This was just so I can have something up that's mine. Nothing was particularly wrong with the old theme other than getting bothered by git about its vulnerabilities. I just wanted more customization and something in React since I know that a bit. </p>\n<p>But anyway, thanks for reading.
