If I had unlimited riches, I'd spend quarter of my year there, a quarter in Korea, a quarter in Japan, and the final quarter in Michigan (or wherever my family is). Funny enough, despite all the good memories on several of the islands, I hate the ocean. I fear the ocean. </p>\n<p>On my first trip to Hawaii with my family, my family decided to take one of those vacation packages that takes you out on a boat and go snorkeling. The tube you breathe through, staining my throat with the algae and salt and whatever else was pooping in that ocean, was smooshed onto my mouth, and I had to fight all my instincts to breathe underwater. Think about that for a second: <em>breathing</em> underwater. I did see some pretty sweet fish, and then people around me started to point down at something else - a turtle! I swam closer to it, slowly descending a little bit lower to get a better view, breathing in and out as I've forced myself to do for 20 minutes at this point, but at some point, the waves rise higher than the tip of the tube. Without warning, you're swallowing sea water and throwing up right in the ocean. </p>\n<p>I'm pretty sure this is just my imagination to make the scene more dramatic, but I swear fish started to swim up and eat my you-know-what (vomit). That stuff scars a kid, the coughing and thrashing, the saltiness overwhelming your senses that your tongue is tragically numb. Over the years, I've snorkeled on occasion, but at this point in my life, I don't think I'll ever go into the ocean willingly, and if I do somehow stumble in, I'd stay very close to the shore. </p>\n<p>I'll keep my second ocean story short: I wanted to go surfing. I rented a board and went out. I took one guided class a year prior in my previous family trip to Hawaii, and I have no clue why I was so confident but I thought riding the iconic waves on the North Shore would be easy. I almost drowned.</p>\n<p>I had that same swallowing of salt water, the same panic, but this time I was reaching for anything to get air. And once I got a mix of sea and air cupped in a desperate gasp, I was overrun again by another wave to restart this cycle. I really thought I was going to die. </p>\n<hr>\n<p>I drove a lot this weekend, from Michigan to NYC to Richmond. On that drive, amongst the mountains scarred by TNT, across bridges that are engineering miracles, through the trash that is New Jersey, I had a flashback to the ocean and those memories, thought that could fill the post quota for the day.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why name a candle ocean mist when the ocean almost killed me","date":"January 10, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-09-ocean-panic/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842"]}
