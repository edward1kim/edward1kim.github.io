I realized I've hit an all time low of care for others a few weeks out from the presidential vote. It always felt like a us versus them scenario even if we were all Americans. I didn't think much of it because (as said in a previous post) conservatism at this moment is what I believe to be a moral evil. But the issue came when my malice towards Mitch McConnel and Ted Cruz (and DT I guess) started to bleed to other parts of my life. </p>\n<p>I started resenting anyone not following covid protocols, people that bothered me at work, everyone else that got in my way... An extremely unhealthy way of going through a pandemic. I was raised to always think about myself first - I think that was just my parent's way of surviving since they couldn't rely on anyone else except themselves. Compassion wasn't something I trained up, but I knew I had it. </p>\n<p>From my experience, it seems like people have compassion originally, but it gets clouded through the other things in life. I definitely fell into that trap. It felt like I forgot how to care about other people, especially beyond my close circle. </p>\n<p>My prescription for humanity is to have more compassion. We're so close to ending this pandemic. So have more compassion. It's nearing March and I'm thinking of where to donate my next batch of money. I definitely am donating any covid relief check(s) to an organization that can help people. I may keep donating to food banks or donate to an org that fights child hunger. </p>\n<p>Better to donate any money to people in need than gamble some money on stocks, am I right? You'll never feel bad for helping someone. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Practicing compassion","date":"February 27, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-27-practicing-compassion/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
