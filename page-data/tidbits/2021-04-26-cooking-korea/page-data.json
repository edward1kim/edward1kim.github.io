It's a very short moment, right when the grandma comes to the family from Korea. In her suitcase, she brings back all these Korean spices, anchovies, herbs, the whole ordeal. And the mom cries with joy. </p>\n<p>It made me think why I cook Korean food anyway. My parents and many immigrants cook Korena food because that's the food they grew up with. It is <em>their</em> food. But I feel like I cook it to remind me of my mom's cooking. It's all pointing back to \"home\". </p>\n<p>In my journey of learning my parent's cuisine, of which I've inherited, I feel a deeper connection to Korea but feel fake in saying it's my homeland. It's not. I wish it was. </p>\n<p>But at least my dad beat it into my head to buy the Korean brands and things made in Korea to show support. If I have the choice, yes I will buy Korean salt over all the other salts in the world. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"cooking korea","date":"April 26, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-04-26-cooking-korea/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
