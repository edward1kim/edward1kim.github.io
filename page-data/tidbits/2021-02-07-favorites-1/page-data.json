Tarantino is just a new age Western director, an absolute genius is script writing. The main parts that stick out to me is the music when the Bear Jew comes out from his cave and the longer-than-normal shots to intensify the tension. The casting is perfect for this movie. </p>\n<p>I love rewatching scenes of Tarantino movies. It feels like his films give more to art and performance than the plot, and I feel like that increases rewatchability incredibly. Like okay, Avatar is a 2.5 hour movie of pure CGI flexation, but would you rewatch it every year or two? Yeah, no. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Favorites 1","date":"February 07, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-07-favorites-1/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
