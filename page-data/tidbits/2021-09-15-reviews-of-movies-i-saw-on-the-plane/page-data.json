Good job Delta! Reviews below.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Goodfellas</strong>: 9/10</p>\n<p>I've seen this movie before and been rewatching a lot of scenes recently. I liked it even more the second time! Scorsese has a fantastic way of telling a story. His voice is so vivid and the way things are shot and edited support that voice. It's just an overall good movie to sink into.</p>\n<p><strong>Moneyball</strong>: 7/10</p>\n<p>This is just a fun movie. Nothing crazy about it; I think it's a finely told story but as far as impact, it does the job and that's it. Brad Pitt is pretty amazing in these types of roles: A strong, headfast male lead who's more handsome than smart and is incredibly charming. He's basically the same character between Moneyball, Inglorious Basterds, and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, and he kills it every time. Jonah Hill was great but wish he did more.</p>\n<p><strong>Nomadland</strong>: 4/10</p>\n<p>I wonder how this won over Judas and the Black Messiah. Not saying I liked that movie a lot, but this movie seemed more... deep but also not that deep? It definitely gave me a different perspective to things - I'm no nomad and I don't anticipate I'll be one any time soon. I felt that the story wasn't as compelling - it felt loose. I felt like a camera that's just coming along for the ride. The pacing felt slow and by the last third, I was just waiting for the end. It was shot really well though. </p>\n<p><strong>Joy Luck Club</strong>: 2/10</p>\n<p>Yeah... I did not enjoy this movie. I've heard about the book and the movie; heard great things about both! Maybe it's because I am neither female nor Chinese, but I didn't feel moved by this story at all. I felt myself cringing a lot actually or just bewildered by some plot points. There were 8 stories told, 4 moms and 4 daughters. They were all just short stories, but things didn't feel cohesive.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Reviews of movies I saw on the plane","date":"September 15, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-09-15-reviews-of-movies-i-saw-on-the-plane/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
