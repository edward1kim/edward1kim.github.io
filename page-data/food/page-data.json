I made the mistake a year or two ago, as I was shadowing my mom cooking soondubu, that cooking Korean food seemed easy. Umma immediately scoffed, replying \"This is just one dish, we still have to do the banchan.\" How naive I was... You can dumb down Korean cuisine quite…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"A college man's carbonara","date":"February 14, 2021","category":["food"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/food/2021-02-14-a-college-man's-carbonara/"},"excerpt":"There are countless carbonara recipes on the web, all fair and probably pointing to what an original carbonara is. The use of guanciale (cured pork jowl/cheek) is core to stay in the lane of authenticity, but I have never seen guanciale in a Kroger.

Any Korean can judge how good a restaurant is based on its kimchi alone.
