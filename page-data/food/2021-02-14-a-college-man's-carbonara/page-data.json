The use of guanciale (cured pork jowl/cheek) is core to stay in the lane of authenticity, but I have never seen guanciale in a Kroger. And honestly with the use of super fatty pork, it makes the dish way too rich. Yeah, if I'm looking to impress, I'll try to make it as rich as possible, but carbonara to me is a solid candidate for the drunchies and that means dumbing it down and dismantling the purist gastriarchy. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Core Changes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of guancile, I use bacon (thick preferably but any size will do) or honestly... deli ham is very very good. Just add some olive oil (like a teaspoon or less) to the deli ham to mimic \"bacon grease\". You just want some fat to fortify the sauce and to add meat because a bowl of just pasta is pretty gross</li>\n<li>Green onions are optional but recommended to get some contrast with the richness of the dish</li>\n<li>Sriracha adds a spicy and acidic kick, which normal carbonara is seriously lacking</li>\n<li>Kimchi on the side because I'm Korean and kimchi elevates everything</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spaghetti (1 or 2 servings)</li>\n<li>Water (enough to cover spaghetti)</li>\n<li>Parmigiano-Reggiano (1/4 cup approx. shredded)</li>\n<li>Pecorino-Romano (1/4 cup or less, shredded, can leave out but supplement with more parm)</li>\n<li>Bacon or Ham or any pork meat (6 baby's handfuls, cut into small pieces)</li>\n<li>2 eggs</li>\n<li>Salt</li>\n<li>Pepper</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Recipe</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Boil the water and add the spaghetti. You can salt the water, but don't go overboard</li>\n<li>Cut up bacon or ham to bite size pieces. Add to separate pan on medium heat and render fat/get some browning. Add some olive oil if using ham.</li>\n<li>In a metal/glass bowl, add in your Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino-Romano. Add 1 egg and another egg yolk (use unused whites from this egg for a whiskey sour). Add pepper. Mix together til it's a incorporated. It should resemble a cheesy ectoplasm. It'll be loosened later with pasta water. </li>\n<li>Check the meat if it's browned to your liking and let the oil cool for a bit off heat. You're going to add the meat and rendered fat into the bowl, so it needs to cool down so it doesn't curdle the eggs.</li>\n<li>Add meat and fat to bowl. Add noodles straight from the pot to the bowl. You should have pasta water that is carried with it. DO NOT THROW AWAY THE PASTA WATER JUST YET! Mix the pasta and sauces together with tongs. The sauce should start to coat the noodles. Add half a tablespoon of pasta water at a time to get the perfect consistency. The latent heat from the noodles should thicken everything up, BUT if it does need some more heat, put your bowl over the pot of water and gently let the steam heat from the buttom. Be careful for any curdling!</li>\n<li>Serve! I top mine with green onions and Sriracha, sometimes with a side of kimchi if I have it on hand. But ultimately, this is for a night out and you're hungry. I wouldn't sweat it. Just get your food in, chug some water, and go to bed.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"A college man's carbonara","date":"February 14, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/food/2021-02-14-a-college-man's-carbonara/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
