Umma immediately scoffed, replying \"This is just one dish, we still have to do the banchan.\" How naive I was... You can dumb down Korean cuisine quite a bit, where anything that is truly lengthy in recipe and/or process can easily be bought in Whole Foods or Trader Joe's. That wasn't the case even a few years ago. I really think Korean flavors are having its spotlight right now. </p>\n<p>Yesterday night and continuing to this morning, I finally got to work alongside my mom to make much needed kimchi as our supply was running low. My recent inspiration was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TI949vGM4JM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this Eater video</a>; my biggest takeaway and the one change I convinced my mom to do in her recipe is using a stock of dried anchovies, kelp onion, green onions, and some other things I can't remember in making the paste. </p>\n<p>We started last night slicing and brining the napa cabbage (for the ignorants, the logo to this page is a napa cabbage) and making that stock. Then, this morning we got to work in washing the cabbages for sediment/sand and residual salt, letting the water drip off, and creating the deep red paste for maximum flavor. </p>\n<p>This entire process took a total of 14 hours, with actual work (not brining) being 5-6 hours. I've made kimchi 3 other times before, but this was the first with my mom. I've been in a recent slump lately for reasons I'm still figuring out, but working every leaf on a napa cabbage with salt and mixing the sludge and lathering leaf and paste like shampoo was a learning experience unmatched by any video or experimentation. I think I leveled up at least two times today. </p>\n<p>For the people that don't know how to cook, I hope you start cooking. For the people that know how to cook but haven't started fermenting, you should get on that. For the ones that ferment, my kimchi is better than yours. Yes, that's a euphemism. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/mton25Jb7Am5ZwC26\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Some photos of the love</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Also how fitting is this title the day after Valentine's day?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The labor of love","date":"February 15, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/food/2021-02-15-the-labor-of-love/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
