When I look back at photos when I was 2 to 5 years old, I'm usually mid-chew or holding something half eaten. Food was my friend! And other people let me know that food was my friend, comments about my size, my rolls, my chins, all that.

I don't think I've ever had a story make me laugh and gasp in a span of a sentence.
