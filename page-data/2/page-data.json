Even if my peers are responsible traveling, that doesn't mean the people that they influence in some capacity are. I've been trying to be more compassionate for a while and that's what's been keeping me indoors…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The labor of love","date":"February 15, 2021","category":["food"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/food/2021-02-15-the-labor-of-love/"},"excerpt":"The labor of love is kimchi.  I made the mistake a year or two ago, as I was shadowing my mom cooking soondubu, that cooking Korean food seemed easy. Umma immediately scoffed, replying \"This is just one dish, we still have to do the banchan.\" How naive I was... You can dumb down Korean cuisine quite…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"A college man's carbonara","date":"February 14, 2021","category":["food"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/food/2021-02-14-a-college-man's-carbonara/"},"excerpt":"There are countless carbonara recipes on the web, all fair and probably pointing to what an original carbonara is. The use of guanciale (cured pork jowl/cheek) is core to stay in the lane of authenticity, but I have never seen guanciale in a Kroger. And honestly with the use of super fatty pork, it…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"A moral loss","date":"February 13, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-13-a-moral-loss/"},"excerpt":"The only time I ever turned on C-SPAN (mind you it was on YouTube) was the slightest chance to see something right. How can someone so abhorrent be allowed to assume the most important position in America and then do everything wrong? As I wrestle more with my political leanings, I can understand…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The cure for boredom","date":"February 11, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-11-the-cure-for-boredom/"},"excerpt":"I'm in one of those periods of boredom. It always comes and goes, but the feeling is probably one of the worst in the world. I don't think anyone likes feeling stagnant.  I wonder if it's the sum of everything that's going on in my life, which is nothing. I don't have much to look forward to, no new…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Favorites 1","date":"February 07, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-07-favorites-1/"},"excerpt":"One of my favorite scenes in cinema is from Inglourious Basterds. https://youtu.be/RBobeT9cXK4. This scene describes the introduction of the basterds, who only play a sideline role in my opinion despite the movie's titles, but they are by far the most entertaining groups with some absolute fantastic…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Pagination Problem","date":"February 05, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-05-pagination-problem/"},"excerpt":"I have to say... I'm pretty happy with how this website looks! It was a lot of finnicky styling, copying and pasting and crossing my fingers that it'll work. I am especially proud of how the navbar items glow when your mouse hovers over it and same things when hovering over the posts on the page. I…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Thanks!","date":"February 05, 2021","category":["life"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/life/2021-02-05-thanks!/"},"excerpt":"Thank you to all the friends who wished me a happy birthday. I keep my birthday pretty low key because I like spending my birthday like most other days, ending with a quick celebration with family. But every year, my friends still remember even after I tried to erase its existence from the web…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"FAQ","date":"February 04, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-04-faq/"},"excerpt":"I've always wanted to do a Ask Me Anything, like the ones you see on reddit or YouTube, probably because I wanted to be famous. I'm sort of an attention whore, and my ego has not been fed in a while. So let me pretend that I'm famous for this moment, like I'll write a memoir one day, like I've…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"I LIKE SOGGY BREAD","date":"February 01, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-01-i-like-soggy-bread/"},"excerpt":"I said it. And I wonder if anyone else agrees with me. Let me explain what I really mean though - I don't mean bread dipped in water by the way. That's so gross. I'm talking about the last bits of bread from a sandwich or burger, soaked in all the oils, fats, condiments, maybe the last bits of…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"covid","date":"February 01, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-02-01-covid/"},"excerpt":"I have to remind myself often that this is a pandemic. Millions of people have died and there are still people that are incredibly irresponsible roaming without masks. I have to remind myself not to trust anyone, for the sake of my family, because friends can be asymptomatic. Exceptions lead to…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Learning Something New","date":"January 31, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-31-learning-something-new/"},"excerpt":"This past Friday, I got placed into a new team in my rotational program. I'm going to spend the next month transitioning, tying up any loose ends on my team right now and onboard to the next. I just messaged my new manager a bit back and forth, thinking I'd be working on some already made…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Best steak","date":"January 30, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-30-best-steak/"},"excerpt":"The best way to cook a steak is reverse sear. However, eat steak maybe once every few months because that way it doesn't lose its novelty. Honestly, I'm getting a bit tired of meat - I can't remember the last time I craved meat. It's just part of my diet so I eat it. But do I love cooking steak. It…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Han","date":"January 29, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-29-han/"},"excerpt":"I learned at the end of 2019 about Han. My friend Chris was talking to me about it in the context of Parasite and Korean cinema, how a lot of these movies revolve around this concept of deep, hopeless sadness that's ingrained in every Korean out there. It is a shared sorrow. It is Han. That is why…"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Yuck, social media","date":"January 27, 2021","category":["tidbits"],"isHead":false},"fields":{"slug":"/tidbits/2021-01-27-yuck-social-media/"},"excerpt":"Social media is so incredibly boring these days. I think I first realized my addiction to it when I was going up the stairs mid last year and instinctively took out my phone to swipe through Instagram stories. That was quite the shocker. Later in the year, I started to purge my followers/following…"}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":["tech","food","life","tidbits"],"title":"Home","limit":15,"skip":15,"next":"/3","prev":"/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
