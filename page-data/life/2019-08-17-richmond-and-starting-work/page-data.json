I moved into my 1 bedroom 1 bath apartment, which I signed completely blind, and finished my first week of work. I can firmly say that I love having my own place, and I love working at Capital One already. I feel very fortunate to be in the position I am right now. I met a good amount of people in my program already and a group of peeps went out last night to some bars. After experiencing the food, walking/driving around the city, and going on a few runs, Richmond is a seriously slept on city. A week ago, I thought this place was a boring town with not much to it, but I think it has the perfect blend of suburban calmness and city fun. It's Ann Arbor but way more fun. </p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm having a good time. It's good to be back in a routine of some sort. I officially got my internet today, so I can officially start scheming about my future in Richmond. </p>\n<p>To any friends out there, please come through and visit. I promise you won't regret it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Richmond and Starting Work","date":"August 17, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/life/2019-08-17-richmond-and-starting-work/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842"]}
