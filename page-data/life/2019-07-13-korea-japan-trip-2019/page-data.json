This trip was planned to get better with each city, ending with Tokyo before heading back to Seoul. However, my personal favorites were Kyoto, and Nara, which were just day trips while stationed at Osaka. I got the most knick-knacks in Kyoto and Nara had an extemely scenic garden (my best photo in my opinion). Thinking back, I'm in disbelief at the number of different places we've visited, and it never felt like we overstayed anywhere. Up until the last day, I would have said I'd be back, but we missed our flight back to Seoul—what a sour note to end on (no excuses, we overslept and did not anticipate how annoying getting to Narita would be). Despite that, great trip! I was most impressed with Japan's parks; they're exceptionally well kept and emotionally beautiful, even the ones that are in the middle of the city. For example...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/KR-JP/bear-garden.jpg\" alt=\"nara-garden\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/KR-JP/fuk-castle.jpg\" alt=\"fuk-castle\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/KR-JP/shinjuku-gyoen.jpg\" alt=\"shinjuku-gyoen\"></p>\n<p>If I could redo this trip, I would have ventured towards the country-side. These Japanese cities do not kid around; they're massive. It was hard for me to differentiate the uniqueness between Tokyo and the other cities, so by the time I was at our last stop, I didn't have the motivation to explore as much. This is staunchly different in the states; we just have New York City. After a week of traveling, I was itching to get back to the suburban life. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/KR-JP/osaka-castle.jpg\" alt=\"osaka-castle\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/KR-JP/nara-park.jpg\" alt=\"nara-park\"> </p>\n<p>This post was supposed to be about how great my trip was, some details on the itinerary, and then conclude with a column of pictures. But I'm realizing that the most important thing about this trip was the time spent with my two homies and some other friends who coincidentally were there also. The new food, cities, and culture only elevated the experience, which was the whole point of this trip anyway. Maybe I'll be back to Japan with a different motivation (i.e. food touring, learning the culture, etc.), but this one was about having fun. Good friends is the easiest way to have a great trip.</p>\n<p>For some stupid reason, I do not have a group picture, so here's all three of us committing to the picture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/KR-JP/me-committing.jpg\" alt=\"me-committing\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/KR-JP/rykim-committing.jpg\" alt=\"rykim-committing\">  </p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/KR-JP/rylee-committing.jpg\" alt=\"rylee-committing\">  </p>\n<p>Till next time.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Korea/Japan Trip 2019","date":"July 13, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/life/2019-07-13-korea-japan-trip-2019/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
