I'm currently back in Michigan with my family for at least the next 5 months. It's nice to be home again - I went from a 95 degree and humid armpit of a state to a sweet, sweet 75. One downside of my time home is time away from my girlfriend, who is also spending the next months with her family and probably missing me also.</p>\n<p>We always planned on taking August to December back home. Definitely would not be possible with the three kittens we got. </p>\n<p>I'm still really sensitive about that whole situation with the cats (Look, I can't even say exactly what the \"situation\" is). I think about them every day; often when I have a short break between work meetings, I get jolted back to the idyllic moments them, of them laying in the sun, running around and playing with each other. But most times, it's that awful moment of giving them back. I was getting dinner with two friends recently, one of them already aware of the \"situation\" and the other in need of an update. The friend that knew made a joke about it, and I had to uncomfortably catch up the table on what happened. That conversation's been on my mind lately because I usually cope with tough times by joking about it. It makes it easier to face. But this is one of the first times that I try my hardest to distance myself in thought and emotion from what happened than face it and own it. I think it's the looming shame I carry. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"misc updates","date":"August 01, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/life/2021-08-01-misc-updates/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
