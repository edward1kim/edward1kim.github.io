It's the first day of July, and it's time to reflect on the past 3 months and set new goals for the next quarter. </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>April to June Goals:</strong><br>\n1. Run 100 miles total<br>\n2. Learn Rust (read through the entire book)<br>\n3. Learn Korean</p>\n<p>I'll go through each goal below.</p>\n<p><strong>Run 100 miles total</strong><br>\nIn April, I ran a total of 22.3 miles. I transitioned from the treadmill to runs outside for this set of 3 months, but I couldn't keep up the same pace due to inconsistent weather and mounting responsibilities in school. Plus, running outside is magnitudes harder than the treadmill. I'm supposed to average 33.3 miles a month but was 11 miles short.</p>\n<p>In May, I ran a total of 37 (59.3 total) miles. I moved back home to Rochester, MI and found a really awesome 3 mile river trail nearby. By the end of the month, I ran a 6 miler, which I haven't done since senior year of high school. It was a great month for me! But still short 7.3 miles, which I hoped to make up in the final month.</p>\n<p>In June, I ran a total of 26.7 (86 total) miles; 14 miles short of completion, sadly. I was running about 12 miles the first week and a half, but then I left for a two week trip to Korea and Japan. I also hurt my left calf right beforeâ€”pushed myself too hard on one run. In Asia, I tried to fit a few miles in, but it's hot and humid and I walked 10+ miles everyday. When I was back, I obviously couldn't run at the same pace as before. </p>\n<p>In these past 3 months, I realized all I need is consistency. I broke everything down to monthly benchmarks at 33.3 miles, but in this next cycle, I'm going to set weekly quotas and possibly go on a running plan to keep myself accountable. </p>\n<p><strong>Learn Rust (read through the entire book)</strong><br>\nSelf-learning is hard; self-motivating is even harder. This was a monstrous goal in retrospect, to go through over 600 pages of text while applying the knowledge also. Plus, Rust has its ideosyncrasies that makes it hard to understand at first; I thought I could learn the language with C++ as my base but the gap between the two is larger than I anticipated.</p>\n<p>Likewise to my previous goal, I was desperately in need of a outline or plan. I didn't have any study schedule but rather read through the book when I had extra time. I'm on Chapter 14 of 20 (7 chapters left). If I can munch through 2-3 chapters a month, I'll be finished. I'll get through three chapters is July since it's the last month of summer and two chapters in August/September when I start work at Capital One. </p>\n<p><strong>Learn Korean</strong><br>\nIn the beginning of May, I went to my local library and rented out a grammar and vocab book. My mom also used her connections to get me some elementary school Korean books. I have barely touched any of these resources if at all. </p>\n<p>However, I consider this goal my only success in these three months. Since coming home, I pushed myself to talk more Korean with my parents, and when I was in Korea, I read, listened, and talked the language at every opportunity. Just being in an atmosphere where I needed to pull my Korean-chops out allowed me to learn.</p>\n<p>I realize that knowing another language, especially my mother tongue, is probably one of the most important things I can accomplish. Over these past few years, I've grown more proud of my heritage, and I'm finally <em>not</em> okay with my incompetency. It's a small success that I can talk and listen a little more; I'll take it.</p>\n<p><strong>New Goals</strong><br>\nUnintentionally, my past goals were split into a fitness goal, knowledge goal, and skill goal, which I'm going to keep the same format of. Also, looking back at my progress, instead of engaging with three huge goals, I need to have a combination of large, medium, and small goals. </p>\n<p>With all this in mind, my goals for July to September are:\n1. [L] Run 100 miles total (stretch goal of 120 miles)<br>\n2. [M] Get through rest of Rust book with plan highlighted above<br>\n3. [S] Write post or series of posts on Korean food</p>\n<p>The L/M/S represents a large, medium, small goal, respectively.</p>\n<p>The first two goals are essentially the same from the previous set, but the latter is something I've been thinking a lot about. Growing up on this cuisine, I never realized how unique Korean food is, even among other Asian cultures, and despite its unique flavors, it's becoming more and more mainstream within the western pallete. This goal follows the theme of learning about my Korean heritage while also learning more about food. </p>\n<p>The theme for these next three months is consistency. Everything needs to be accomplished by September 30. Check back in 3 months, please and thank you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Goals for July to September","date":"July 01, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/life/2019-07-01-july-sept-goals/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
