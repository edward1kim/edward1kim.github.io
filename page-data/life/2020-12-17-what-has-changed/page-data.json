So much has happened in between. I thought I was done with this website, but here I am, in some kind of mood to write. I'd like to write more about the CODA program and how my first year of TDP has been. I want to document my entire tech journey. But today I want to talk about my recent introspective findings and how it has allowed me to enjoy my life more. </p>\n<p>For context, it's pandemic times, and consequently I've been work from home since mid-March. At this point, I've nearly worked from home longer than I've actually been at the office, which is absolutely crazy to think. If I'm going to be completely honest, I don't think I'd be able to find my desk anymore. It doesn't help that every floor in my building at work looks basically the same and is also mirrored with a coffee sanctuaries splitting the two sides. But now my work area has been my desk in my apartment, which turned into a work area at the house my girlfriend and I live at now, but as of this exact moment of typing this word, I'm at my parents house in Michigan. Unlike some of my peers, I've really enjoyed the working from home experience. I remember how unproductive it felt to go to work and be on a computer all day and then go home and be on a different computer for the rest of the night. Now, my chill spots after work have just turned into work zones, and some Pavlovian experiment run by God trained me to detest sitting in my desk chair after 5 PM. </p>\n<p>Which I don't mind at all. Despite the world growing closer to decimation - and I'm not talking about just the virus neither - I've been able to pick up/try out a multitude of hobbies. I'd like to reserve a post for every hobby I've entangled myself with later, so that isn't the topic right now. Rather, what I want to talk about is the change in mindset that allowed me to do this.</p>\n<p>It's always been a very competitive environment growing up. My schools, from elementary school to even college, have been relentless. In 3rd or 4th grade, there was a selective math program that students got to go to in the middle of class; I believe it was to train the \"gifted\" or simply the faster learners. I'd be so jealous of my friends who groaned about skipping recess to do this program (PACE I think was the name?). Some other friends and I wouldn't really know what to do for our play time since 90% of our crowd was gone. Then, my prayers were answered in 5th grade: I was chosen to take a special test to skip the intro math classes and jump straight to algebra (8th grade math). I remember taking this test, not really knowing what I was doing, but I got passed enough.</p>\n<p>Have you played Halo before? I haven't but I watched my dad play through the campaigns. To save myself from butchering the lore, I'll be quick: There are kids that are selected to partake in the Spartan program where they're injected with some steroid that kills most kids but the ones that survive become the most powerful warrior in the galaxy. I felt like a Spartan entering algebra as a middle schooler. Consequently, I was surrounded by very smart, capable, and competitive people where grades and scores were everything. I was in this cohort of people from 6th all the way to 12th grade. For those 7 years, your mind just adapts to what makes you the best or the least above the average.</p>\n<p>I explained all this to get at how I framed everything I pursued before. Even if there was no direct competitor, it felt like I was comparing myself to someone. I think that's why I never really got into art. It takes diligent practice to draw something remotely good, even with a natural talent. (Aside: There was this less than delightful person named Peter Hao who would yell at me in League of Legends and force me to be his support as he AD carried. He told me straight up that no matter how hard you work, you'll never be better than someone who's naturally gifted, which I completely disagreed with. He really had it backwards, and I hope he's found more peace with that.) Whenever I attempted to draw something, I would be disappointed because in my mind, the thing I drew would never be comparable to what a great artist drew. This self-inflicted comparison pushed me away from a lot of cool hobbies. If I didn't have a natural talent for it, then why even try? </p>\n<p>Here's another quick example. I really enjoyed tennis throughout middle school and freshman year. I took classes, had a ton of fun, and was going to try out for the team. I got cut from the team and dropped tennis altogether. There was a whole team of people that were better and I lost all hope in getting to that level after the coach said I wasn't it. </p>\n<p>That mindset gets pretty toxic after a while. It's weird that finally, after the world turned completely upside down, that I'm framing everything completely differently. Instead of saying that what I did/made is complete garbage, I tell myself, \"Edward, you couldn't do this thing yesterday or even a few hours ago, but now you can do it or some semblance of it! That's progress and I'm proud of that.\" It's a pretty simple switch actually. I'm just having no pressure in being the best and enjoying the craft at its core. </p>\n<p>This single change has really increased my overall happiness and confidence. I'm very proud of what I've accomplished this year. So if you want to talk about or see how I got into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raw Denim</li>\n<li>Coffee</li>\n<li>Sketching</li>\n<li>Birding</li>\n<li>Oil Pastels</li>\n<li>Music</li>\n<li>Food/Cooking</li>\n<li>Clay Throwing</li>\n<li>Ceramics</li>\n<li>Whiskey</li>\n<li>Yoga</li>\n<li>Chess</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let me know.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What has changed?","date":"December 17, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/life/2020-12-17-what-has-changed/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842"]}
