It felt like my college experience was defined by a chase to be successful. With no experience, I was begging for any company to give me a chance. I spent more time applying to jobs and taking quick naps than paying attention in class, eventually exhausting all relevant chemical engineering job postings and moving to business ones, which was a larger pool. I think in a single semester of my senior year, I sent out over 300 applications with only 10 responses. I'm sure if I was a statistician's life experiment, they'd think my atrocious rate was a clear error or God's way of saying that I need to be humbled. </p>\n<p>But after getting that first job, doing pretty well if I say so myself, this hunt wasn't bad at all. I felt pretty for once, wanted in company terms, like I finally made some right decisions, watered all my seeds, and bloomed magnificently in spring (I've been playing a healthy amount of Stardew Valley lately, hence the farming simile). Of maybe 50 total applications, I've gotten interview opportunities with more than a quarter of them. These are very healthy odds.</p>\n<p>The grind itself was unbelievably taxing mentally. There's a clear limit on how much studying I can do but a bottomless well for how low my self-esteem can dip. On a bad day, I would lie down on the carpet thinking about squandering opportunities. I been so fortunate so far but when I needed to perform, I was going to fumble. This happened multiple times.</p>\n<p>I took a walk outside just before things got cold for fall. There's a trail near my house that's been my retreat from life - a short three-quarters of a mile to a bridge from the trailhead where I would often stamp my foot to signify I did this and turn back around. The segment back to my car, even though it's the exact same trail but in reverse, feels so much faster. On one of these walks, it occurred to me that I'm already in a very safe and happy place. That job offers and company prestige are meaningless if I can't see my family and friends. So that centered my attitude going forward: I was only doing this because I'm fortunate enough to.</p>\n<p>I must have told myself \"Don't sweat it\" nearly everyday. I didn't dare let a bad interview linger in my head for too long. That's relinquishing too much control.</p>\n<p>In the end, I found a really awesome opportunity that's completely remote. Pretty happy with it and will allow me to continue splitting time between Richmond and Michigan. </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Also open to mock interviewing if anyone is going through the same experience. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"job update","date":"October 23, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/life/2021-10-23-job-update/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
