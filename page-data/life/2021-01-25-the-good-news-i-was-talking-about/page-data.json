It feels like the clickbait on Linkedin is the antithesis of clickbait everywhere else: short and catching. Anyway, this post. He started talking about how he had a sticky note of his goals to get promoted end of year, how he had it stuck on his monitor since last March, a constant reminder of what he was working for, yadda yadda. And then of course, he finishes the post by saying he achieved everything he wanted to achieve!</p>\n<p>Can't say that's the same situation for me. This promotion came as a complete surprise, and talking about it more with another senior engineer, I honestly have no idea why I got promoted. But we take those, no matter the circumstances.</p>\n<p>So I'm hyped, I'm ready, a little scared of what more responsibility will look like because I have a pretty nice work-life balance, but what can ya do, I can't <em>not</em> take the promotion, right?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Good News I was Talking About","date":"January 25, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/life/2021-01-25-the-good-news-i-was-talking-about/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
