All the engineers on my team and even in my organization are very smart and just seem like they know what I'm doing. I'm just that kid absorbing the elder words. I've done a pretty good job reading documentation and learning .NET/C# to keep up with everything too. Two months in, I'm quite comfortable and happy, which is something I'd rarely say in my previous team. </p>\n<p>However, my mentor on the team decided to leave. A vast amount of knowledge was lost with this man... and I, being the enthusastic noobie, am thinking what more I can do. The team is small, with just me, another senior engineer, and our manager. I should be able to find my niche and maybe vie for that next promotion if I do decide to stay here. My manager did say if I keep up what I'm doing, I'll be able to get there in another year or so. </p>\n<p>We are also bringing in two new engineers on the team, both probably more experienced than me, but I may still be pushed out of my comfortable nest and have to explain what's going on to a new set of noobies. I do not know what I'm doing...</p>\n<p>Anyway. I signed up to present on how to build a static blog for free with React Gatsby at work for this group called the Craftsmanship Club. Just a bunch of tech nerds doing nerd stuff. Also my girlfriend asked me to do a hackathon with her too. That sounds more daunting than the presentation. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"more responsibility","date":"May 05, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/life/2021-05-05-more-responsibility/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842","3603904796"]}
