My foodtuber-watching journey started with Epic Meal Time. Just absolute carnage of a show, especially in the wild, unruly days of YouTube. I think they might have coined the Turducken. Pretty disgusting to be honest, but that was their whole image. Indulgence. I wasn't into food or cooking then - it was either late middle school or early high school - but I got pretty tired of their videos after a while. It felt repetitive. Probably should have slowed down their eating and got into the mukbang craze.

Now, I'm more into the learning side of foodtubers, the ones that go through recipes, give tips, and consequently you just fall in love with their personalities. It's always the person that convinces me to subscribe and invest in their journey. Yet, more often than not, I end up ignoring the new videos or unsubscribing completely once I feel they've become too gimmicky. Let me take Binging with Babish for example.

He made enjoyable, well crafted videos. The channel united food and cinema together, and he was pretty easygoing. I really rooted for this guy. However, as I grew as a home cook, my interests shifted from entertainment to growth. I needed to get something more than a few laughs or ahs from a video I'm investing 10+ minutes on. At this moment, I think all of Babish's videos are gimmicks, and if I'm being *really* honest... I don't enjoy watching Stump Sohla at all.

This is the same reason why when I did watch Bon Appetit before Cond√© Nast collapsed under its racism, I disliked Gourmet Makes (pretty similar to Stump Sohla). No shade on Claire nor Sohla; I think both are very enjoyable personalities. It's just that the premise of their shows were 90% pain and 10% educational. I did not enjoy watching Claire have a breakdown in the middle of every Gourmet Makes and then learn how to temper chocolate for the 10th time. That's not why I watch food videos.

I'm afraid Joshua Weissman is joining this wave of gimmicky foodtubing. All his But Better/Cheaper shows and B-roll endings are getting really old... Brad's It's Alive had the perfect balance of education and fun, and it never relied on a framework because it basically had no framework. I liked Joshua at first because he knew how to cook really well and had the restaurant training too. But he really needs to stop with the baby voice, the butt squeezing/slapping, etc. His earlier videos were SO much better despite the inferior production soley due to his immense knowledge.

Anyway, I just wanted to rant about these foodtubers. I acknowledge the hard balance between knowledge and personality. Some people watch these videos because these people are fun to watch and if these shows (or gimmicks as I like to call it) get views, then who am I to say it's not entertaining. However, there are still channels out there that I happily subscribe to. I'll list the foodtubers that I still enjoy and are hoping they don't turn into gimmicky channels as they continue to grow their following. Under them, I'l list some of my favorite videos. Almost every video below is enjoyable and educational *as a home cook* for me, usually more one way than another.

- J. Kenji Lopez-Alt (I love almost every episode on his channel, especially his first person vids. I've grown more as a home chef from Kenji's than any other videos on YouTube)
    - [How to Make Real Guacamole](https://youtu.be/7KjWFcIi4_8) : this convinced me to buy a mortar and pestle during Prime Day
    - [Sweet and Sour Chicken](https://youtu.be/BNyVPQoCibg) : made this a few times already and velvetting has made chicken breast eatable again
    - [Miso-glazed Salmon](https://youtu.be/51GpBG4iJcA) : also made this a few times with white miso and ddengjang under a broiler
- Adam Liaw
    - [Hainanese Chicken](https://youtu.be/XPA3rn1XImY) : this video always brings me happiness, he's so easygoing and optimistic and he cooks very very well
    - [Mille-Feuille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPQOTKxj63Y) : I actually made this today, it has one of the highest deliciousness to difficulty ratios (in other words, it's easy to make and extremely unctious)
- Chinese Cooking Demystified
    - [Whole Steamed Fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUyw0V7X1tg) : great first recipe if you want to try cooking whole fish
    - [Why Chinese Food uses so much from the Americas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irrRrr1FvmQ) : I learned a lot from this
    - [Stir Fry Any Vegetable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-Yu8qOAEYQ) : I haven't cooked a lot of their recipes but the stuff I learn from all their videos translated to a lot of my cooking
- Internet Shaquille (he replied to me on Instagram once and I'll always remember)
    - [Fuck It Up Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr0nckv6sftk8tx9U3ywSWJ4Y_jRokB2x) : my exception to the gimmick rule because each episode is pretty special and I love Mr. Shaq and friend's personalities, Joshua Weismann should take note
    - [A True Pizzaiolo Never Eats Solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGQ71_bjvSw) : I want a pizza oven so bad and I'd chase Youtube fame one day to write a pizza oven as a business expense like Shaq
    - [An Introduction to Bagel-Making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6B6fGhOm3g) : the biggest appeal for Shaq is his to-the-point style of videos, also I've made bagels using these steps and they're pretty great
- Ethan Chlebowski (recently found out about him, he's a more palatable and likable Adam Regusea)
    - [how I built a HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL DIY Kitchen Island](https://youtu.be/k6m0XH1fV7w) : I have no need for a movable kitchen island but I like the build and it gets me thinking of potential DIYs for my kitchen enhancements
- It's Alive by Brad Leone (Almost all of these videos are because I like Brad's personality and how he interacts with other people, plus I learn a lot)
    - [Brad Makes Dry-Age Steaks](https://youtu.be/RAWvd_9La5c)
    - [Brad Prepares and Cooks Pheasant](https://youtu.be/i80OccEM1Fo)
    - [Brad Makes Campfire Breakfast](https://youtu.be/yyubL84R5Mo)
    - [Brad Goes Spearfishing in Hawaii](https://youtu.be/iXsVKqDXrZE)
- Bon Appetit (I've basically stopped watching all BA vids except for this series, which I come back to often)
    - [Every Handcrafted Episode](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKtIunYVkv_SsxML1CfZLcTDYsUnBewaf) : especially the soba, 3 artisinal breads, and all the butcher ones
- Epicurious
    - [How to Filet Every Fish](https://youtu.be/wcueSXGueJs) : the guy is really good at explaining things and fun guy
    - [How to Use Every Japanese Knife](https://youtu.be/FDNNG9doFe4) : this video opened my eyes to a bunka knife and also to chuboknives.com, where I eventually got my first Japanese knife
- Munchies
    - [How To Make Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK1m8rnjk2w) : based a lot of my taiwanese beef noodle soup research/recipe build from this video and it turned out delicious
    - [Hawaiian Fried Chicken](https://youtu.be/ek_CUJY-Jmc) : discovered gochujang aiolo from here, also really like Sheldon
- Eater
    - [Omakase Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUeEVLHfB5-Qsx-3arUU2tLGzHvsJ_yOB) : I love every one of these episodes
    - [How a Chinese Barbecue Master Has Been Roasting Whole Pigs for 30 Years](https://youtu.be/YsyHUkUuwo8) : the fact that this guy made everything in this video basically before he opened his shop is worth a shoutout
    - [Kato/Jon Yao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGbFtTYQpus) : I liked this video enough to pitch into a kickstarter for a book about the restaurant by Jon himself.

This seems like a pretty good list for now. The Food YouTube landscape is getting bleaker, but hopefully new interesting channels pop up to my very specific tastes. Thanks for reading my random thoughts.
