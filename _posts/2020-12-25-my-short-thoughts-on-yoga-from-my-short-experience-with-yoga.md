Near the end of November, I started doing yoga at home with this [Yoga with Adriene's 30 Days of Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-UzwxbWCWDbTzEwsZnnROBTIL). I wish I started this in high school or even earlier. I had pretty bad back/neck pain from being on the computer all day, inactivity due to covid, and everything else going on, but yoga has singlehandedly improved all my pains. It's rejuvenating. 

I don't really buy into all the spiritual aspects of yoga. I can see why yogis get memed on and are a weird pseudo-cult. I do have issues with yoga being commercialized, and I wonder if some yogis aren't aware that it's from India. But I'm not really doing any research myself in understanding the full history of this practice beyond a Wikipedia read. All I know is my own experience: it works.
