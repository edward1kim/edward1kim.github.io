&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 14 May : Fly to Denver, CO  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 11 June : Train to Chicago, IL  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 12 June : Fly to Seoul, KR  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 16 June : Train to Busan, KR  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 17 June : Fly to Fukuoka, JP

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 26 June : Fly to Seoul, KR (which we missed our initial flight and had to buy another)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 27 June : Fly to Chicago, IL and drive back to Rochester Hills, MI

There was always something to look forward to this summer, peaking with my [Korea/Japan trip](https://edward1kim.github.io/life_posts/korea-japan-trip-2019). Once I was back, an airport was the last place I wanted to be at. I had a little over a month left, sandwiched by my big trip of the summer and the beginning of work, before I moved out to Richmond, VA. This period is what I refer as the moment between moments. 

To be specific, it's the small moment between the big moments. Most days, I wake up not knowing what day it is and passing time on my computer until I have to sleep. It's unsatisfying; it's boring. It's the doldrums. This is in contrast to when I'm in school, where there's a set regiment of classes, homework, and friends. I always had something to do, even if I thought I didn't, because not only was I a very popular *and attractive* person with many, many meetings, I was also a budding chemical engineer. But in the doldrums—complete opposite story.

I'm a week out from my move in date, and in this past month—the moment between moments—I don't feel like I've moved forward at all. I don't have anything to showcase (except my BSE in Chemical Engineering). I appreciate the rest and the freedom to do whatever I want because I for sure won't have that with a classic 9-to-5, but I'm not going back to a familiar campus with familiar friends with familiar everything else. I'm moving to a place with absolutely zero connections and no idea what's next. Fun fact, I haven't even seen my apartment yet. 

There's a part that's fed up with the doldrums and another that's scared for the next big moment. It's a weird irony of being excited for something I'm not sure I want yet. What am I supposed to do? I'm in a state of unbearable dissonance! 

I want to end this knot of thoughts with an anecdote.

In my yesteryears, I took violin lessons. I needed to if I wanted to make Symphony Orchestra at school. I had a fearsome teacher, who was an absolute unit on the violin, and he really pushed and yelled me into a decent player. I remember a quick conversation we had when he made me play two notes a half step apart from each other together (this is called dissonance by the way). I said in passing, "I don't get dissonance. It sounds so ugly," thinking we'd just move on to the next few measures. Quickly, my teacher retorts, "What do you mean?" I reply, "Well, these notes don't fit together. Why would I want to hear something that hurts my ears?" 

Nonchalantly, he says, "Well, without dissonance, music would be boring. You need dissonance because it makes things interesting. You have dissonance so it can be resolved." Then, he looked away out the window behind me, signalling for me to continue playing.

I have no idea why I remember this so clearly, probably because I knew deep inside it'd be a relevant anecdote someday. As far as what my next steps are, I'm just going to let this battle go on, let the two notes ring together until it's resolved. At least it lets me realize I'm still a functioning human that hasn't succumbed to the lazy lifestyle of July. I still have a week to prepare both logistically and mentally for the big move; hopefully I'll be accepting of my fate by then, whether I'm ready or not.
