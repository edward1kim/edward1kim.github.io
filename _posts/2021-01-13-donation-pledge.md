I was a chubby kid. When I look back at photos when I was 2 to 5 years old, I'm usually mid-chew or holding something half eaten. Food was my friend! And other people let me know that food was my friend, comments about my size, my rolls, my chins, all that. I don't think I ever registered what that meant - *chubby* is just cute fat, right? But, without me even knowing, those forgotten quips about my weight still left a scar. It grew an insecurity that's latched to my being... that stuff sticks with you forever. 

*When was a time you got bullied?*

I only remember one time that I was bullied. It was day 1 at a Christian day camp in 6th grade at a local church (ignore the irony). I was basically tagging along a friend's youth group, so they all knew each other and I was meeting them for the first time. Everyone was pretty friendly except for this one guy. I had no idea who he was, but in that first day, he made some fat joke at me in front of everyone. He must have kept making those kind of jokes throughout the day because I remember how ashamed I was for being big. I think anyone who grew up chubby knows these tricks: the tshirt pull so my stomach or breasts weren't visible, keeping my head out so my chins didn't show, wiping my sweat so I didn't look like a pig. I remember getting a hotdog at the end of the day and leaving it on my plate uneaten because I thought that guy would make fun of me if I took a bite. Do you know what it's like to tell everyone you're not hungry when you are? It's embarassing.

I was 10. That shit *sticks* with you. I have this flashback several times a year, and I still feel the guilt for being overweight and then going home and telling my mom I was hungry and then crying. It sticks with you. 

So today as I was taking a walk outside after work, I got that flashback. I was thinking how that single moment was still affecting me today. As a kid, I was confused why people would talk about these small traumas as adults because so much has happened since - wouuldn't it get better with time? Oh, how naive I was: I'm 13 years detached from that day and I'm still living with that shame.

So why am I telling you about this? Why did I go through the hassle about explaining the genesis of my insecurities? 

I made a pledge to donate this year, but as I'm looking through multiple nonprofits, I wasn't sure where I wanted to put my money. Basically all that I said above was a summary of my thoughts and why I want to give to stopping hunger. It's the opposite from my situation. I ate too much and was made fun of, but I was thinking how much worse it is for a kid to not have enough food and the impact that'll have when they're older. Those scars run way deeper than anything I've experienced, and it's so much worse right now with the pandemic. 

Hunger should not be a problem anymore. That is my reason to donate. 

For January, I am donating to the **Council of Peoples Organization**, a food pantry in Brooklyn. They were featured on an episode of NYT's The Daily, and I haven't stopped thinking about them since that episode. My goal is to donate to an organization that fights hunger every 2 months for the rest of this year. 

I am extremely lucky to be in the position that I am in now, to have my sanity and health. I can walk, I can run, I can go up and down stairs without any issues. I feel more or less the same at the beginning of the day. I have a loving family who supports me, and a supportive girlfriend who loves me. I am fortunate. So I feel it's my social responsibility (and others, especially *you* billionares) to give away my excess because there are people that need it more than I do. 

For whoever reads this, I'd love to know if you want to donate alongside me this year, so please shoot me a message. There are so many nonprofits and organizations doing good that I'm sure there's one that will tackle a cause you care about.
