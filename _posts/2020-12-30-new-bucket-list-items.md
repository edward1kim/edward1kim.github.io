Recently, I've added some new life goals/bucket list items. 

- I want to operate a bootleg restaurant out of my house, known through word of mouth and would cost enough to cover groceries and a dessert for my team. It'll be my way of flexing my cooking prowess and creativity.
- Somewhat along the same lines, I want to organize a food retreat with some serious home cooks and dedicate 3 days to experimenting, cooking exotic/expensive ingredients, discussing, eating, drinking cocktails, and finally pull off a 5 course meal for friends/ourselves. Sort of like what El Bulli did when it was still running.
- Lastly, I want a nearly self-sustained dining experience, meaning I want all plates/bowls made by me, my table and anything wooden by me, all food cooked by me. I always admired that Tyler, The Creator wrote, produced, and arranged every one of his albums, and this goal is my homage to him.
