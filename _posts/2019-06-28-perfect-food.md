Over the holiday season last year, I came across a reddit post in /r/leagueoflegends about a new docuseries on Netflix titled "7 Days Out." Each episode went over the preparation done a week before the start of some of the world's biggest events. There was one episode on the North American League Championship Series (NALCS or just LCS) 2017 Spring finals. I highly recommend that episode, and without spoiling much, it gives a crazy behind-the-scenes of one of the most tragic events in League eSports scene. 

In that same series but a few episodes back, there's an episode on Eleven Madison Park (EMP): three Michelin star restaurant, operated by Daniel Humm (head chef) and Will Guidara (restaurateur). When it was awarded 2017's best restaurant in the world, the restaurant went under renovation, a controversial move since it was arguably at the peak of its culinary stardom. It goes through the days (seven to be exact) before the reopening of the restaurant. I absolutely love this episode.

A single quote stuck out to me since my initial watch. Starting at 12:51, lively jazz music starts playing and several close up shots of the restaurant, people, and employees are spliced together. Will Guidara and Daniel Humm start talking about the dogma of EMP—what goes through their minds every night of service. Will ends this montage with the quote below.

> "I don't think we're in the food business.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think we're in the service business.  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;We're in the human connections business."  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*- Will Guidara,*  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Restaurateur, Eleven Madison Park*

I want to reiterate that I love this episode, so much so that my sister got a reservation for it in the middle of this past April as my graduation present. I always end up fumbling my words whenever anyone asks how the meal was. I can describe the tiniest details the front staff thought of to make the meal amazing; I can describe the combination of flavors over the course of the meal that sincerely made me emotional. But every paragraph would end with "I don't know... it was just incredible." It's so hard to describe without pouring out my heart and everything that food means to me.

Still, I wanted to write a little blurb about this experience, not because I'm some Michelin star whore or a pretentious fine diner—simply, it was *that* impactful to me. The reason why the quote above stuck out to me is because Will Guidara, Daniel Humm, and their team built out a vision, creating a whole new dimension to eating at a restaurant. By adding a little perspective, it made something as mundane as eating to something unforgettable.

This meal is perfect food because it made me think more about the work that goes into creating a perfect anything. It's an appreciation I can bring out to everything else in my life, and it fed a dream to work in the culinary world something I'm deeply considering. I'm not going to drop my career as a software developer, which hasn't even started by the way, to be a chef. But I'm really wondering how I can make someone else appreciate food the same way this one meal has.

If everything goes according to plan, I'll stop wondering, take out my beautifully seasoned cast iron and Victorinox knife, and start cooking.
