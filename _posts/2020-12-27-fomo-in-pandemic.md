Usually, I don't get fomo. Usually, I'm very comfortable with myself that I can wrestle with any jealousies. Usually, if I wanted to do something, I can do it. There would be no "missing out" - usually. But it's getting harder and harder to find that inner peace in the pandemic, as I hear about this person and that person going somewhere more exciting, and I'm home, very bored. If my goal is comfort, then boredom will be my greatest foe. 

When there's nothing going on, I'll want something to do, but when there's too much going on, I'll want to do nothing. I'm pretty sure this was a core theme of Candide.

So I wonder if I'm one to risk travel during a pandemic, to give up comfort for adventure, see if the experiences I think I'm missing will fulfill me more than my everyday. Maybe this dilemma is what's making me ween off social media. I can't take another influencer posting about their negative test results like that email justifies their license for fun.

I'm not really sure what I'm saying. I'm on PTO until the first Monday of 2021 and I have no clue how I'll spend the next 7 days. I'm missing the homies, the gym, restaurants, spontaneous trips, planned trips, reunions, haircuts where they don't miss a few hairs around my mask straps. I've been to NYC 3 times already this year and all I've wanted was to leave right away. One thing I'll forever hate no matter what is the actual traveling. I dislike being at airports, waiting, the anxiety of missing another flight in my life, sitting in a seat for hours. That will never be fun.
