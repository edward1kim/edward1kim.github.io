I was caught in a memory today. 

I'm back in high school; I think I'm a freshman. It's almost impossible for me to place myself back at that age - either I'll think I'm too wise or too foolish. It was for the most part a normal year except for the news that a very talented violin player who I was in middle school orchestra with passed away suddenly. I didn't know the guy that well. I think we liked the same girl in 7th grade and that's about it. But I think that was my first moment of death around me.

I've been to funerals before but never of my closest relatives. The one funeral I went to was my grandma's brother I think. I didn't really understand what was going on. I was maybe six. But even at that age, I can clearly remember passing by the room with the casket, everyone gone except for my grandma leaned against it and weeping. 

When I first heard, I think I cried. I don't really know. The day of his funeral my parents told me it wasn't best to go, so I just wore all black and went to church. I kept the reason for my melancholy attire to myself.

My violin teacher taught him for a ton of years. I feared this man. He made me a better player, but I never asked to be yelled at. It seems like the norm among musicians, and his record for improving players is very high. I think at one point, any single person wanting to get to the highest level of orchestra had to learn under him. He would get you there and beyond. But this one day was different. Instead of his quiet frustration, I could feel an atmospheric sorrow. I don't really know if we got through a lot of playing in our hour together. He would just tell me little comments about Caleb, how talented he was, what a loss his death was. 

I haven't thought about Caleb in years. Why did this all pop into my head as I was making dinner? No triggers. Huh.
