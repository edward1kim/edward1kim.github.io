I've been occupied with a few different projects this past month. I will give my initial thoughts and impressions of said projects:

**Recipe Book**

As said in a previous post, I started recipe book! I have around 30 recipes listed with a majority filled out. My goal is to get all of those recipes filled by the end of April, do a week to review over those recipes, share the doc with some friends to proofread, and then add more recipes! 

I've gone for a pretty straightforward format split into:
- Title
- Difficulty out of 5
- Special Equipment, if any
- Description/Story
- Ingredients
- Instructions
- Notes
- References

I've been trying to group ingredients to parts of a recipe if applicable. For example, doejang jigae can be split to *spices and base*, *meat and vegetables*, and *finishers*. This is to cut time your eyes would wander to find a specific portion of a recipe.

I've also added a References section because none of these recipes are really mine... They're a collection of all the different research and recipes I've also viewed. I'm sure most of them are 90% similar to what I've referenced. 

The link is in a previous post if you want to take a peek.

**Sub Irrigated Planter**

Inspired by [Internet Shaquille's video](https://youtu.be/mRhLZM-cJZ0), I finally acquired all the supplies to make them, starting with three variety of tomatoes. I planted a four seeds per planter, but I'm not sure if they will germinate... If they don't, I'm just going to buy saplings later. Not much updates here, just a waiting game.

**Homemade Doenjang**

Once my heated pad came in, I can finally start making this. It'll be a yearlong project, starting this Saturday. No updates yet, but I hope nothing bad happens. Please no flies or black mold!
