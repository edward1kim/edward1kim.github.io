To anyone that has listened to me rave about food, I'm sure my love for [J. Kenji Lopez-Alt](https://www.youtube.com/user/kenjialt) will come up once or twice or many many times. When he was posting his first-person Youtube videos, I would cook alongside him. These videos would determine what I ate for the week. 

As a result of his job and being in the food industry, he has some beautiful kitchen items, one of them being [Earlywood](https://www.earlywooddesigns.com/) spatulas. There's just something so special about wooden items. Even though it takes more care compared to its silicon/plastic counterpart, there's an attachment that's built with oiling every nook and cranny, smoothing the grain... It almost glows after. 

I wish I could remember Kenji's exact words about these spatulas and anything beyond, but I'll try my best to paraphase:

"I believe that you enjoy cooking *more* when you enjoy the things you're cooking with."

Something like that. This can be taken outside of cooking too. I'd never advise a novice in any hobby/activity to get the highest end of anything, but I do promote the idea of appreciating handmade things, recognizing the difference from one and another, and getting attached to your stuff. It's part of the fun anyway.
