6/10. 

I thought the film's strengths were in the characters. A lot of the dialogue exchanged between the parents really struck me emotionally because the intonation and language reminded me of my parents. I never knew of any struggles they went through, and my parents themselves don't like talking about it. I didn't know we even had a recession in 2008-2009 because my parents never brought it up. The yelling, the emtions, the faces, it was very familiar.

However, the weakness of the film is the story itself. I thoguht it built itself well but things just seemed half baked. The pacing was moderately slow, yet I wished the movie kept on going so I can see through everything. I felt like I was watching someone's actual life than a story of someone's life. I wanted more. I'm also not a big fan of open ended endings, so a big turn off already.

Overall, I'd recommend someone watch this movie just because of Steven Yeun's amazing acting and that it was nominated for Best Picture. Other than that, I doubt I'll revisit this film.
