As I scroll through my Tik Tok feed, I come across these cute kids being cute. I'm talking like 3 year olds. And there's one that comes on my feed a ton; the kid's name is Grey. It's an entire account dedicated to him. But man... I think you're a bad parent if you do this to your kid. All the content is never crazy but the simple fact of posting videos of a kid in situations the parent obviously conjured is simply whoring your kid out for views.
