Social media is so incredibly boring these days. I think I first realized my addiction to it when I was going up the stairs mid last year and instinctively took out my phone to swipe through Instagram stories. That was quite the shocker. Later in the year, I started to purge my followers/following. It was a simple test: Do I care about this person or care to keep up with their lives? If no, then the decision was easy. I just did another purge today but of influencers/celebrities; I was getting tired of the sponsored posts. 

I'm pretty close to closing my Instagram account entirely, but we'll see if I actually follow through. I already suspended my Facebook account, but I still use Messenger because no one likes texting someone with an Android. TikTok would be my last social media in use after that, but honestly that's about to go too if the algorithm doesn't start suggesting more cooking, art, woodworking, clay throwing, or Vine-energy videos.
