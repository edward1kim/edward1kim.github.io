yesterday was so weird. i had a panic attack in the morning. i was playing a game of chess before i headed into my first meeting, and it felt like my brain was short circuiting. i wasn't really thinking... it almost felt out of body. i had my normal thoughts in the foreground, just thinking of different lines. but it felt like my mind was ripping halves after halves, uneven bits by bit. it was like a fever dream, a stuck nightmare. even now as i record in lowercase i can only remember blips of it.

it only lasted a few minutes. i ended up losing that game by the way, not because of my panic attack but because a meeting came up.

it's so weird. the day before i was enjoying the sun, watching anime, having a game night. life was great. and then i panicked...?
