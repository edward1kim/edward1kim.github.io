Recently, anime has been the one thing keeping my engine running. Catching up on the hot series has been the best use of my time for the past month, especially since it looks there's there's another renaissance of anime right now. But anyway, my quick reviews...

**Attack on Titan**

Oh my GOD. I remember watching a few episodes of this when it first came out but couldn't sit through some of the animations. After seeing a ton of hype about it, watching a complete spoiler video recapping seasons 1-3 on YouTube (thankfully not understanding most of it), and a friend telling me it's one of the best shows she's seen, I binged it all in a single weekend. And my god... for the ones that just want a fantastic plot, THIS IS THE ONE. For the ones that want to appreciate amazing animation, THIS IS IT. For the ones that say they don't like anime because it's anime, you are narrowminded. I'm saving the last season of Attack on Titan for one last binge sesh later this year.

**Demon Slayer**

Only 1 season out so far, and I cannot wait for the next season. I heard it's a pretty short manga series too, so maybe... just maybe I'll read it. The animation is probably the artsiest in the modern anime scene. The world is awesome. I found some of the characters really annoying, but so is any show. I just skipped through it. I don't think I've ever been more compelled to buy figurines until I watched this.

**Haikyu**

I just caught up to the most recent season 10 minutes ago. This show took a while for me to love - I thought the beginning was a little boring and frankly... volleyball isn't that interesting to me. But the creators/writers/animators sure know how to make something *hype*. There is something so special about sport animes... I feel like I invest more into these characters than anyone else in my life. Season 3 was by far my favorite of all time. Can't wait for more.

Will be getting back on the writing train as I cure my neck pain and find a topic to write about.
