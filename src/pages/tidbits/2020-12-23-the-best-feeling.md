One of the best feelings in the world is the nostalgia of food. It is comfort. I can't say my experience is exactly like Ego's when he took a bite of Remy's ratatouille, but I experienced something similar a few Saturdays ago. My mom cooked this one stew made with beef, potatoes, tofu, and ddengjang. It had some other things in it. My mom couldn't put a name to the dish, just something she made, but I haven't had it for a few years at least. At first bite, it just was more than deliciousness - the flavor pulled from the depths of my heart: me a few years younger, definitely a few pounds lighter. 

Pictures are worth a thousand words but food nostalgia... that's unmeasurable.
