I was out with my dad in our back porch as he was taking a smoke break. As I stepped out and faced right towards my dad, the sun shined directly on my face - a divine light signaling the break of the pandemic or possibly a bright omen to turn back indoors towards safety. In the end, it was making me squint my eyes and my dad laughed at me. 

I leaned against the railing, still swaying side to side. I breathed only through my nose, the air still cold but trying its hardest to warm up. The only sounds were some children playing in their backyard playset a few houses down. I've always wanted an out of body nostalgic experience, a dunk in the pensieve like in Harry Potter, a blast from the past that pauses life for ten or fifteen minutes so I can really relish in the memories of my youth. But the reality of memories is just a flash. Just that. And I get more of a flavor on my tongue, like Fun Dip (remember that candy?). In previous years I wanted more than anything to skip forward to a better time, then I started working and wanted to stay in the present to take in my fortunate circumstances and now I wish to be the kids down the block with less care and more life. 

I thought I heard a bird singing evenly back and forth - oh, is spring already coming? Are birds coming back home from their long migration? Is it time for newness?

But it was only the swings down the block. With the kids down the block. Like a replay of my elementary days. 

My dad finished his cigarette and we went back inside.
