Last night, I made the best joke/comment/line/lyric in my dream that surpassed all other jokes in dreams in existence. My laughter escaped from unreality to actual audibility out of my dry mouth at 7 AM. It was like that dream when I was 5 where my mom was the pink Power Ranger and was fighting off these monsters by herself. I was cheering her as she kicked and punched like in the shows, but then more monsters started to come into frame and they surrounded my mom. And four of them finally got a hold of her, and as my mom struggled for freedom, another monster had a syringe with a long needle and injected her neck with some clear liquid. My cheering turned to shouting and I was panicking. She started to bloat uncontrollably, like a very bad allergic reaction; I saw the last sliver of her eyes signaling me to run and then the swelling shut them closed. I cried over my mom's body and woke up weeping for her. It was like that dream but the opposite. With my eyes still closed but turning myself over from my stomach to back, I recall thinking I should write down my zinger, but unfortunately it was already forgotten between the grey seams of dream and reality. 

I can recant all my awful nightmares but can't for the life of me pull out a good dream. All I remember is a feeling.

It was a 5 out of 5 dream for that single instance of triumph, albeit I know nothing more than that. So 16 hours since I grabbed my water bottle next to my bed and chugged enough for me to have a pseudo-food coma, I write my review of said dream where I delivered the envy of... myself I guess since I really wish I recorded the details somewhere.
