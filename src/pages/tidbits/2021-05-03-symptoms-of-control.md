So bear with me as I lay out some thoughts I had during my run the other day.

I've been doing a short run every few days around the lake in my neighborhood. Each lap around it is almost exactly half a mile, which makes tracking and bearing through the run easier. Recently, the Canadian geese in the area had baby birds; with each day I decide to go out for a run, I see these babes turn older and older. 

At home, my tomato plants finally poked out of the ground with a pair of leaves. For a bit I really thought I would have a fruitless start and have to succumb to spending on sapplings for my tomato needs. I told Wendi that we're on a tomato strike til I get my own tomatoes - an unnecessary stipulation and stress on my tomatoes to perform well. And they did, a bit too well. I had to throw a few sprouts off my balcony to prevent crowding. At this moment, it's a waiting game. 

Likewise, I finally hung up my three meju blocks for drying and mold growth. I'm fighting an urge to just chuck these blocks away as I see all the white and green mold growing in the cracks. It's a different feeling to have purposeful mold growth... I make sure to visit them every minute I can and just stare and what new things are happening in those blocks. I've been writing down observations and weighing the water loss over time. It's the closest I've felt to real scientific work. 

I bring these three examples up because they ended up being outside points of consistency for me. They are my symptoms of control, though it's hard to say if these projects came from my desire for control or were independent clashes. Regardless, I can feel myself peeling my life onto these growing birds, plants and molds.

I've been wondering if that's why I've been feeling more laid back and happier. It's like I've packaged my desires - to know what is happening and what I can do - onto these projects. Is this okay though? I've been wondering on the chance that something fails. What if my plants fail and get diseased? What if my meju gets infested with flies? Who even knows what's happening with the birds! I wonder if I'll fall into a slump because I've relied on something to hold me up too much.
