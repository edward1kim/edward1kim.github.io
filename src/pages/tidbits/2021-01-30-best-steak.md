The best way to cook a steak is reverse sear. However, eat steak maybe once every few months because that way it doesn't lose its novelty. Honestly, I'm getting a bit tired of meat - I can't remember the last time I craved meat. It's just part of my diet so I eat it.

But do I love cooking steak. It's so simple, so involved. I think I get to practice a lot of timing, patience, and focus when going through the entire process. Plus, I get to balance making a side dish or two and clean as I go. 

Details of Steak and Process:
- USDA Prime Ribeyes from Costco
- Left overnight uncovered on a rack in the fridge
- Put into oven at 170 degrees and shutting off oven/heating up to 200 degrees to adjust timing for when parents came home
- Sear on cast iron with Chef's Press 
- Flip after 30-60 seconds, sear for another 20 seconds and put in butter, garlic, and thyme
- Baste flavored oil butter on steak
- Cut into pieces
- Parents like it medium well
