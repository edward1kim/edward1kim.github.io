title: How was my day today

Did you guys know I used to have a password protected Tumblr diary that I'd write in nearly every day for 4 or so years? I'd give the link and password out to friends so they could keep up. I stopped that maybe my sophomore year of college. It was definitely one of my most dedicated pastimes, possibly only topped by violin (1st grade to 12th grade) and following eSports (6th grade to now)? This would be an example of one of my posts, albeit the format was fluid.

I woke up before work today but not as early as I've been waking up recently. I have my alarms starting at 6:30 AM with a new alarm every 15 minutes, hoping that I'd get a yoga sesh in before logging into work, but alas, dreams be memes. Speaking of dreams, I was in that half-sleep half-daze after my 5th alarm, and what ultimately brought me out of bed was a tapping on my shoulder. I jolt up and look around to no one, but I swear a dementor was tapping me awake. 

I've been on a pretty nice cooking spree at home. For the ones that don't know, I've been in Michigan with my parents since the beginning of November. Took a week in early January to drive to Richmond and move all my things out of my apartment, and now I'm back in home til end of March. I've come to think of my role as a son more seriously since the pandemic. My parents are still working their store(s), and I've been trying my best to do what I can to support them, aka cooking, cleaning, taking out the trash, grabbing groceries, getting takeout, picking up prescriptions. I've come to relate it to fine dining - specifically the one meal at EMP - because small things add up and by doing whatever I can do by being here will only make my parents happier, whether they know what I did or not. 

This is why whenever I get my dad a coke, I always open it for him, tableside. Just so he doesn't have to.

So I cooked my mom a sandwich this morning! She ate half and I ended up eating the other half for my lunch plus some dumplings. They went off to work and I logged into mine. I had some catch ups in the mornin, but besides that, I've been SO lazy. My current project is basically over besides some documentation writing, and I'm about to rotate to a different team in February. Like, come on, am I really supposed to do anything else with my day other than chat some friends and check that everything is working okay? Let's get out of this idea that we should be hussling and rather think about the reality. Also it's pandemic, who has time to worry about testing when *that's* going on? I actually shoveled some snow today because I'd rather spend 45 minutes out in the cold breaking my back than write another sentence about my project. 

I took an hour nap after work, unintentionally. Makes me wonder how I took a nap every day in high school. 

Got Chipotle for dinner with my parents, which was pretty garbage. I would not eat Chipotle again until I can see the food being made live. 

I messed around with my website styling a bit more. I'm having a lot of trouble making it responsive, so for the peeps viewing on mobile, I'm sorry. Any bugs or weird looking components or suggestions for this site, please reach out. A friend already messaged me about the navbar not adjusting when zooming in and I got a fix for that pretty quickly. Also don't look at the source code nor the commit messages for this site... I'm extremely lazy so I'm not going to write good commit messages AND I just learned this React framework and React seems to have changed syntactically a bit since I learned it. But anyway, webdev is hard blah blah blah. 

Nothing coming up in the future. I was supposed to start watching Attack on Titan today with the girlfriend, but the mood for anime was not the mood tonight.
