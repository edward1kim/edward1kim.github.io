Recently I've been taking walks when the weather breaks. Sunshine down, sunshine on my face. My life has been severely lacking any kind of outdoor activity for the past few months; I'm surprised I took nearly daily walks after work around my neighborhood. The difference is a chasm. 

I can feel my cells on my face feed on the shine. It's an immediate release of endorphins. Let me know if you feel the same.
