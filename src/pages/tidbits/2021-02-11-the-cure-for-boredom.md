I'm in one of those periods of boredom. It always comes and goes, but the feeling is probably one of the worst in the world. I don't think anyone likes feeling stagnant. 

I wonder if it's the sum of everything that's going on in my life, which is nothing. I don't have much to look forward to, no new packages coming, and nothing that grabs my interest. I'm also alone most days doing boring work since I'm hopping off my current team and starting on the next. Maybe that's why I feel like this: I'm not great with transitions. 

Also I just finished watching the first season of Demon Slayer, and I have that empty feeling after binging something. It's a tough week for Eggward Kim.
