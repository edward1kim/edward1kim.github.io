I said it. And I wonder if anyone else agrees with me. Let me explain what I really mean though - I *don't* mean bread dipped in water by the way. That's so gross. I'm talking about the last bits of bread from a sandwich or burger, soaked in all the oils, fats, condiments, maybe the last bits of tomato or lettuce, kindly held together by final threads of gluten. 

Don't get me wrong, I do have my limits. If the bread is like the seafoam found on the shores of New Jersey, scattered among tangles of limp seaweed and garbage - absolutely disgusting. That bread still needs to have the tiniest bit of integrity. My tolerance is quite high too, so I'll basically eat anything that isn't pure sludge. 

Because I like soggy bread so much, I - and please do not hate me for this - eat my Jimmy Johns sub not from the end but from the open side. This way, the oil and mayonnaise settle on that closed edge and I can maximize sog. Writing about this is actually making me a little queezy, because I know it sounds rather gross, especially since *soggy* isn't the prettiest word in existence (one of my personal favorite is *halcyon*). But I also know the reality of pure bliss. I cannot be the only one that enjoys these last bites, right?

Let me try to compare it to universal loves, purposefully focused on the last bits of an experience... like the stem of an ice cream cone, no contest the best part of an ice cream experience (only applicable to cake cones)! The last vestiges of ice cream before it devolves to just sweet cream, slowly losing viscosity as you crunch to the base of the cone, tear away that stupid strip of paper, and take those last gnaws. The cone isn't soaked perse, but these final bites always feel like the ultimate unity of cream and cone. That is like my feelings towards soggy bread. 

It's like loving a dog. The more time you spend with it, every bark, toss, poop, pee, ruined furniture, play dates, being stopped by every other person in the park for some unwarranted petting (this is all me guessing the experience of a dogowner; I've never had a dog before). All that. But then that dog gets old, can barely climb up the stairs anymore, so you carry it every day and night because you know that's what would make Jimmy happy. And then... I'm totally joking - soggy bread is nothing like loving a dog.

All I am saying here is that I know we all like soggy bread when its treated just right. If I had to make a meal based on soggy bread as my muse:

1. Lobster tomato bisque soup with cubes of fried cheese bread coated in lobster oil (the cubes must sit in the soup and at least one must be eaten at the end)
2. Braised short ribs with raddish (it's like soggy bread because it's braised for 4+ hours, maybe?)
3. Half-melted vanilla and pistachio ice cream stems (the best part of ice cream)
