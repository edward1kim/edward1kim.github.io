I feel extremely fortunate to be on a team with very smart and experienced engineers. I was in a programming sesh with one of my teammates, and we wandered into just our philosophy of technology. I didn't have much to say, but he said a phrase that's been stuck on my mind for a few days.

"Coding as my craft..."

It made me think of the Avatar clip when Sokka is forging his space sword. I was brought back to numerous videos of Japanese sushi masters and the art of perfection. Or the multitude of denim makers in the world sewing their own little patch onto this blue world. A craft! How beautiful.

I feel like I've resigned my profession to just that - a professional experience. Yet switching all that I do as a craft... A method to master... It's the phrase I've unknowingly wanted to ink on my nerdy heart.
