Around here in Richmond, there are more people without masks than with. I feel like the odd one out. I still think it's still very premature to go about without masks - the few failures of Fauci - but if I am to trust the experts and the scientists... it's quite nice to edge out of pandemic. 

I still will be wearing my mask though.

I was getting my haircut with a mask, and my barbtress accidentally clipped my left band. I was holding it up with a little shock, and she apologized. However, she caught herself and followed it with "Are you vaccinated? You don't have to wear a mask here."

"I am vaccinated but I prefer if I did."

She proceeded to give me one of the worst haircuts in my life and for the first time... I asked for a refund on my cut.
