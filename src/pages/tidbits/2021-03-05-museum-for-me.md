The other day I was reading up on Pearl S. Buck's Wikipedia page. I have no clue how I got to this page, but I know I was on Anna May Wong's page first. She is considered the first Asian American actress in Hollywood, which I thought was not even possible in the 1920s. Skimming over her bio, I saw *The Good Earth* credited. Look at how messed up this movie was:

> *In 1935, Wong was dealt the most severe disappointment of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in the film version of Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth. MGM instead cast Luise Rainer to play the leading role in yellowface, due to the Hays Code anti-miscegenation rules requiring the wife of a white actor, Paul Muni (ironically playing a Chinese character in yellowface), to be played by a white actress. MGM offered Wong a supporting role of Lotus, the seductress, but she refused on principle.*

This prompted me to click on Pearl S. Buck because since I first read the book in high school and then not thinking much about it since I never noticed the author was a white woman! I ended up reading through her entire page; she seems like a pleasant person, very impressive in terms of achievement but also her level of compassion. I noticed she had a museum of sorts in her family home in West Virginia - a few hours west of my home in Richmond. 

I started to think about taking a trip out one day, just to learn more about her. Then, I started to think what I may learn about Pearl if I did go: Would I read some tidbit about her daily habits? Maybe see the typewriter she would spend hours on? Her yellowed manuscripts preserved through the millenia? Or would it be even more mundane: a sock she kept from her first marriage, not that it had any significance though. It was just left behind. 

Would I really know Pearl if I went and saw how she lived? And conversely, if I had a museum set up in memory of me, what would I put out to give a normie the Edward special? The more I thought about it, the more strange it felt to have a museum about myself... I guess in Pearl's case, she did accomplish a lot, ya know, with the Nobel Prize in Literature and all, and she did grow up in China, go through the Boxer Rebellion and WWII. I wouldn't have much to offer in my museum that would permit an entrance fee. 

Unfortunate is I who has lived nothing special to others. 

Despite that, I think I'm rather interesting.
