The only time I ever turned on C-SPAN (mind you it was on YouTube) was the slightest chance to see something right. How can someone so abhorrent be allowed to assume the most important position in America and then do everything wrong?

As I wrestle more with my political leanings, I can understand the conservative view, but at this moment of US politics, I cannot agree that they should lead without sacrificing compassion. The acquittal is a moral loss. 

People that are conservatives are bad people. Selfish people. People void of thinking beyond themselves. Humanity without plurality. Or is this just what being human means, to be so divided. 

But so it goes.
