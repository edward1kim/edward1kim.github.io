My friend has suggested this movie for over a year and half, possibly even 2 years. I think the fact that it was about Hitler turned me off for so long, but his persistence was admirable and I wish I watched this sooner.

Jojo Rabbit is what I consider the perfect movie. The cinematography, soundtrack, the story, the characters... THE CHARACTERS! I have such love for them all, and the witty writing brings out the human-ness of everyone despite the crumbling of Germany at the precipice of WWII. 

I will pass on the spirit of my persistent friend by encouraging the world to watch this movie if you haven't already. I have an illegal site that another friend who's a pro Googler showed me. I can link it to you there.
