I saw this one Tik Tok trend where people describe their habits and what person they got that from. It ends with "Human beings are a mosiac of everyone that we've ever met. You are a living memory of every person taht has ever mattered to you, even for just a moment, and I think that's really beautiful." [Here's an example](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMebvx6nE/). Seems like a pretty thoughtful writing exercise.

I place glasses of water or whatever I'm drinking down first before attempting to do anything else because I spilled water when I was picking something up in elementary school and my mom chastised me as she cleaned it all up. 

One of my favorite meals is the simplest: just kim, kimchi, and rice - because before dropping my sister and I off at school, before the sun even rose, my mom would be making this with unbelievable speed, always having at least two ready for us to eat. It's the most nostalgic meal, but I can never get it just right. 

When I catch a kickball, the rare times I have to, I always catch like I'm hugging the ball because that's how my dad taught me to do it. I came home sad from school one day - no one wanted me on their kickball team during recess. I guess he heard me and went to Target and got a kickball. He taught me how to kick and catch until it got dark. It felt like he was making up some of the technique, but it was fun. 

I always wash my knife after I'm done using it. I will never let a knife sit in the sink because that's how my sister taught me when we were making food together in college. I didn't really know how to cook, not as well as now, and she would always feed me during my junior year in college. We were making ground turkey chili, step by step, and the secret ingredient is a little cinnamon. That's basically how I started my food journey. 

I think baby's breaths are the most beautiful flower because that's my girlfriend's favorite. I'm always looking for them whenever I go to the grocery store.

I'm obviously influenced by my loved ones the most.
