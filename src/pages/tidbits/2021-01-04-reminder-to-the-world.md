Everyone got on that Avatar: The Last Airbender wagon this past year ever since Netflix decided to put the series (back) on the platform. And if I can make a not-so-absurd claim with no proof, I think 2020 was the year for social media. More memes spread around, the r/atla subreddit was more active, and people revived the kataang vs zutara discussion. 

But I want to brag about how much of a fan I was before the second save of this great series. Firstly, I saw the entire series on TV. I remember I didn't like the first or second episode of the first book when it aired on Nickelodeon; it was just on after some Danny Phantom rerun. My New Jersey cousins were over in Michigan for a bit. I'm not sure at what moment I became hooked on the show - it just happened. I was 8 years old when Avatar first aired. 

After the 2nd book finished, I remember there was this huge drought and no news of a 3rd season. It felt like YEARS from the 2nd book finale to Aang's next moves, but looking at the wiki, it seems like there was only a 9 month break before the season premiere. In those 9 months, I created a xanga (if you know what that is) called avatarcommunity where we talk about the latest and greatest thoughts on Avatar - no one joined. Also, there was a 8 month break after the Day of Black Sun episodes, and to keep my mind focused on Avatar, I started to write fan fiction for this one shady site that had the next few episodes of Avatar unreleased in the States but shown in Canada for some reason. 

My main character was Iroho who was a waterbender and firebender and earthbender. I also wrote in all caps because I didn't want to deal with punctuation. I signed my name as Edward Kom, thinking that'd be enough to mask my identity, but the owners of that site probably saw the Kim in my email and made that "correction" for me. I only had 2 chapters.

I wasn't very imaginative to say the least.

So to anyone that thinks they're an Avatar stan, please compare your fanaticism to mine. I'd also like to go to a huge anime-con one day, but I'm afraid anime is getting too popular with the "it" crowd (this is based on my Tik Tok observations, but that's completely skewed because an anime lover like me would get recommended anime Tik Toks, right?). Is it still lame to like anime?

I watched a lot of Naruto growing up too, but that's sort of normal for an Asian boy who wasn't athletic (if only I could tell my younger self how pregnant my calves look now). Anyway, people that don't give anime a try haven't watched the right anime I guess. I'd recommend Wolf Children and The Boy and the Beast for anime movies. And Silent Voice. Studio Ghibli movies are always good. Oh my god, Your Name and Weathering With You! How could I forget. Also for some artsy surrealsy work, Paprika and all of Satoshi Kon's work.
