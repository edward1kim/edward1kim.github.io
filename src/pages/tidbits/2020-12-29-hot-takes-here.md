Hot off the press and grill.

**1. Beef wellington is over-the-top and has little payoff**

I have not made a beef wellington before. I have looked into it, but in high school, I was not going to lay out muchos dollars for a filet mignon, which is in my opinion a lackluster piece of meat. I've tossed the idea of making it over the years since, watching that iconic Gordan Ramsay video and a lot of other copy cat foodtubers. But as I've thought more and more of this dish, it did not seem worth the effort of searing the meat, coating it with mustard, wrapping with prosciutto, layering the mushroom pate, wrapping with the puff pastry. This isn't even including the chilling, the prep, all that crap. It isn't even that much meat. I'd rather cook a large tomahawk than even take the first step of a beef wellington.

**2. With the popularity of gaming and the rise of content creation around gaming, the eSports scene lost some of its competitiveness to increasing branding and being hip with the kids**

I have followed eSports since I was in 7th grade, possibly even 6th grade. I know my eSports. One thing I loved about gaming was the competition and the drive to be the best. I only got more and more into it as game developers took ownership of their competitions and created an ecosystem like real sports. However, a lot of that original drive was lost when Twitch started to rise. It wasn't about pro players streaming anymore; content creation focused streamers started to gain a large footing in the gaming world and that ended up being more profitable than competing. Now (my opinion), the eSports teams are pivoting to more content creation to garner more clicks, reducing the quality of not just their videos but also the competitive scene. 100 Thieves is a pretty good example of this. Their LCS team isn't doing too hot, but I heard their CoD team is doing okay...?

**3. Being a Democrat is not a personality trait**

Nor is being a Republican. I have a lot of distrust of American politics. 

**4. People that solely read nonfiction lack imagination**

I've met a few people that read only nonfiction, usually about self-improvement, entrepreneurship, or finance. All that is great, and I've read my fair share of these, but I have never enjoyed reading them. I've met people that scoff at the idea of reading fiction, like it's a waste of time, and to them, I simply pity. Fiction is stepping into another world with just words. That's insane.

**5. There should be no billionaires in the world**

Only trillionaires. Sike. I'm a firm believer that it's impossible to become a billionaire fairly. I also believe that having that much money is excessive, borderline criminal. I understand that usually these people can't just sell their wealth because a lot of their value is in stocks to their company, but like... if I'm being honest I don't think any person should have wealth of over $10 million. Bezos is a villain. Elon is a joke. Bill Gates was a meanie and I guess he's making up for it now with his foundation? Zuckerberg is immoral. Trump is - haha, almost got ya there.

**6. Ariana Grande > Beyonce**

Beyonce is meh.

**7. Drake is garbage**

The only songs I like from him is Feel No Ways, Passionfruit, Hot Line Bling, and Ratchet Happy Birthday.

**8. If you use a glass cutting board, you don't know how to cook**

That will ruin your knife in a single chop. A dull knife is very dangerous. 

**9. I much prefer people that grew up in the suburbs or semi-cities than people who grew up in NYC or California**

Whenever I meet someone new that grew up there (not went to college or moved there later in life), it's always a game of how often they can bring up something about NYC/California. It gets old very quick. Being from these places is not a personality trait. I found that people from Dallas, Austin, and Chicago are pretty balanced and awesome to talk to.
