Dear Me, 

I've always wanted to write to myself, formally. In my senior year of college, I'd post up little phrases like "Have Grit" and "Do More" on index cards above my desk and rarely look at them after. Remember that? Sort of cringey because I'm not a big fan of all that Inspirational Lifestyle Youtuber lingo where you must manifest your ideas before you actually start on anything, and those tacky 2-3 word phrases on my walls could likely have been a mantra of modern day guru-ism. So who knows what I'll put on my walls anymore. Probably more art, whenever I have that tingle to spend money again. I moved in with my girlfriend recently, so I feel like I should have art that both of us connect with. I remember I was *very* close to buying this one [denim banner with a topless girl](https://tateandyoko.com/products/made-in-japan-selvedge-denim-banner) on it, which would have stayed probably in the closet now.

Remember that day at church in middle school when your voice was changing and you didn't really know how to laugh so you did a deep "heh heh heh" (like Beavis and Butthead but more bass-y). Yeah, and then someone asked you why you were laughing like that so you got really self conscious and stopped laughing that day. I wonder how many iterations I went through of different hahaha's before I settled on my current one: sharp and piercing like a snare drum but, in my personal opinion and in the best way possible, a cute giggle. 

I wonder how many iterations it took for Nick Offerman (aka Ron Swanson) to settle on his laugh. 

Best,

egg
