It took me about a week of on and off working to learn the React framework Gatsby, adjust all my posts which are in markdown, reset image paths for the posts that do have images, rewrite some logic, and style. My first real project outside of work after college! I've basically copied the same style as my old theme, but I plan on changing things up in the future as I start to look for my own look and style. This was just so I can have something up that's mine. Nothing was particularly wrong with the old theme other than getting bothered by git about its vulnerabilities. I just wanted more customization and something in React since I know that a bit. 

But anyway, thanks for reading. Peep the CNAME eggwardkim.
