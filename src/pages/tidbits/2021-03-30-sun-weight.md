Michigan living made me think I didn't need to sun that much. The people that came from the south or west, unexposed to brisk walks through the Michigan pseudo-tundras (at least in their minds), would experience seasonal affective disorder, or aptly named SAD. But I, a veteran of snow days and unfortunately blue balls snow days, am strong! I can withstand a winter of sunless days. And I usually do, but maybe it's the year of Richmond living in 70 degree weather starting early March that made me a softie.

I am back in Richmond for a bit. I stepped outside during lunch with a cup of Peruvian (not puff pepper) coffee and took a walk around my neighborhood. I stopped at a lake behind the neighborhood.

I could feel the sun peeling away my worries and stress. I don't think I ever recognized a sun beam's *intensity*. It was definitely stronger than what I'd experience up in Michigan, but it was exactly what I needed, like [those Japanese men pounding the mochi in Nara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmSrULDVRPc), to get the perfect texture. I am that mochi.
