I wonder if growing up means to be okay with not knowing. Maybe even prefer it. When I was a wee teenager, and this question was presented before me by a friend as we were peeling the onion, I couldn't grasp the idea of "not knowing". Wouldn't you want all the details to make a decisive choice? What if this one thing you don't know was the key to everything? I was thinking methodically. Don't leave room for assumptions if you don't have to. 

But as I'm feeling out life more, it isn't a puzzle where one piece will always connect with another. I'm almost more happy to know just enough to not get upset or have to make a choice. Because truth beyond childhood is lots of loss and acceptance of loss. I fortunately haven't had to deal with the death of someone important to me. I'm dealing with loss of respect for people around me and society as a whole at the moment - it's very relevant to the pandemic. Maybe I'm finding myself again? 

"The more you know, the more you realize how much you don't know." So please give me just enough to still have hope in the future. Please!
