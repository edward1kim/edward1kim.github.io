When you say "hours", that means at least 2 hours - 1 hour, 2 hours. But then you say one and a half hourS! That's less than 2, so I adjust my definition to a count of greater than one. Okay, that makes sense: 1.1 hours, 1.25 hours, 1.0000001 hours. 

But 0 hourSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS??? What about 0.5 (zero-point-five) hourSSSSSSS or 0.9999999999999 hourSSSSSSSS??? So is making a noun plural anything except 1?
