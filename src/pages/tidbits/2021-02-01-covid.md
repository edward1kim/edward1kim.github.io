I have to remind myself often that this is a pandemic. Millions of people have died and there are still people that are incredibly irresponsible roaming without masks. I have to remind myself not to trust anyone, for the sake of my family, because friends can be asymptomatic. Exceptions lead to cracks, and cracks only grow wider. 

It feels inevitable to get covid. And once I get covid, I'll spread it to my parents, or vice versa. And maybe one of us will die. A lot of days, it's like a ticking time bomb. 

My first relief will be when my parents get vaccinated. My second is when the pandemic is officially over. 

It upsets me to know that people I hate so much like Mike Pence and Mitch McConnell got the vaccine (albeit they're rather old). I just can't comprehend why their lives are worth more than my mom or dad when they've done so much evil to America. And I really think politics now is more of a moral problem - meaning there is a clear right and wrong, good and evil - than true politics.
