I was recently on a long plane ride with a pretty good selection of movies to cycle through. Good job Delta! Reviews below.

**Goodfellas**: 9/10

I've seen this movie before and been rewatching a lot of scenes recently. I liked it even more the second time! Scorsese has a fantastic way of telling a story. His voice is so vivid and the way things are shot and edited support that voice. It's just an overall good movie to sink into.

**Moneyball**: 7/10

This is just a fun movie. Nothing crazy about it; I think it's a finely told story but as far as impact, it does the job and that's it. Brad Pitt is pretty amazing in these types of roles: A strong, headfast male lead who's more handsome than smart and is incredibly charming. He's basically the same character between Moneyball, Inglorious Basterds, and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, and he kills it every time. Jonah Hill was great but wish he did more.

**Nomadland**: 4/10

I wonder how this won over Judas and the Black Messiah. Not saying I liked that movie a lot, but this movie seemed more... deep but also not that deep? It definitely gave me a different perspective to things - I'm no nomad and I don't anticipate I'll be one any time soon. I felt that the story wasn't as compelling - it felt loose. I felt like a camera that's just coming along for the ride. The pacing felt slow and by the last third, I was just waiting for the end. It was shot really well though. 

**Joy Luck Club**: 2/10

Yeah... I did not enjoy this movie. I've heard about the book and the movie; heard great things about both! Maybe it's because I am neither female nor Chinese, but I didn't feel moved by this story at all. I felt myself cringing a lot actually or just bewildered by some plot points. There were 8 stories told, 4 moms and 4 daughters. They were all just short stories, but things didn't feel cohesive.
