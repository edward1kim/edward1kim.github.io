This past Friday, I got placed into a new team in my rotational program. I'm going to spend the next month transitioning, tying up any loose ends on my team right now and onboard to the next. I just messaged my new manager a bit back and forth, thinking I'd be working on some already made microservices coded in Python and Go, but to my surprise, he suggested I start learning .NET Core and the Entity Framework. What?

So after my anime binge this weekend, I am scrambling to understand C#, how all this .NET stuff works. I know I still have time, but I don't really know where to start. I feel like I've been spoiled by these high level, non-typed, non-compiled languages. I love how Python reads like broken English, I love how you never have to really deal with classes, and if you do, they're simple and sweet in syntax. I love not thinking. 

But I guess techies are so insistent on OOP and using odd words like `namespace` or `public` vs `private` or `bool` (I'm exaggerating a bit here to the fools that don't know). Bool. To the everyday person, that means to chill, have a beer - don't forget.

Here is my hacked plan for learning everything for my new team

1. Neglect my current team because I'm off to bigger and better things
2. Learn the basics of C# and play around with what compiles and what doesn't
3. Go through .NET tutorials
4. Half-listen to .NET videos at 1.25-1.5x speed
5. Learn Docker
6. Learn how to deploy a .NET app

So far, I've watched a 10 minute video on C# syntax and I already feel overwhelmed. Oh well. If I get this, maybe this is my key into Microsoft.
