It's only been a week of having the 3 meows and I am quite exhausted almost on every front. I think I've been getting anxiety from the life change. I'm glad I have Wendi to talk it through. I wonder if it's normal to feel this. 

I feel unprepared. Inadequate?

I had to throw away my meju blocks due to dead bugs falling from one of them and upon breaking them open, my eyes are stained. Of course I had to take a pic - for science. I'll try again in the winter when humidity and bugs are kept to an absolute minimum.
