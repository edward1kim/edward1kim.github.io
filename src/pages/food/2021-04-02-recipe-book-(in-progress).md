I've finally started my recipe book! My good friend Jonathan gifted me *Modernist Cooking at Home*, which is a legendary cookbook. With it came a supplementary, waterproof, spiral bound recipe book that can be used in the kitchen. After reading all the recipes, I thought... I can do this too.

This is still a complete work in progress. So far, I've picked out my font, wrote 2 recipes (one longish and one extremely short), and separated out everything. I know it's still quite premature to share, but I have no clue who reads my stuff so why not? Here! Take it!
