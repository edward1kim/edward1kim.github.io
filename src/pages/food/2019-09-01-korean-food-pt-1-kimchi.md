This is the first of three parts about Korean food, and of course the first topic that needs to be discussed is kimchi, the national food of Korea, the classic fermented spicy cabbage you'd see at any Korean restaurant. Any Korean can judge how good a restaurant is based on its kimchi alone. In today's post, we will learn about how kimchi is made and what it means to me.

As a chemical engineer by degree, I have to start with what fermentation is. A centuries old process, in the absence of oxygen, bacteria and other microbes extract energy from the carbohydrates around it, breaking down whatever it's eating and chemically changing it. It produces acid, ethanol, and gas as by products, which adds to the flavor of the fermentation. Kimchi specifically leans on that acidic element. 

Over time, the food that's being fermented loses its snap and flexes more; the microbes release lactic acid, lowering the pH and safeguarding the food from being inhabited by undesirable organisms. You want your fermentation station to be temperature controlled or the least have it so that the temperature does not fluctuate much. This is why many Korean households have another refrigerator just for kimchi. It's that important to us. 

I had the pleasure this past summer of making kimchi with my mom—the classic kind. We started with the washing and chopping of the Napa cabbage (side note: my favicon and the picture found on the About page is a Napa cabbage commissioned by my sister). Then, we sprinkled an incomprehensible amount of salt into every cabbage crevice imaginable. This isn't any ordinary salt; I believe it said at the Korean grocery store that it's specifically for kimchi because the crystals are larger than your normal cooking salt. And yes, we did pay the extra two dollars for Korean salt instead of the Chinese one. This sat in a huge plastic and metal bowl specifically for kimchi making for a while. The goal of this step is for the salt to initially break down the cabbage while also extracting water from the vegetable. Empty the water that pools at the bottom occasionally.

Once the cabbage pieces are bendy and sufficient water has been extracted, wash off the salt on every piece and it's ready to be marinated in the sauce.

This sauce is a mixture of gochugaru, fish sauce, green onions, sugar, rice flour, garlic, ginger, and I'm probably missing a few other ingredients. You just get this unbelievably spicy red sludge that you coat every kimchi piece in. Put them into containers and let it sit for a month in your kimchi refrigerator.

Kimchi is important to Korean cuisine because it embodies all the important flavors of Korean food. I've grown up on kimchi, and it truly is something no other culture in the world has. Kimchi is purely a Korean endeavor; it's arduous, distinct, and always worth the wait—just like me. It provides the perfect cut of acid to support the richness of everything else on a Korean dinner table. 

This is a good starting point. It's a wonderful, refreshing start to Korean food and leads directly to the next blog: Dissecting a Korean Meal!
