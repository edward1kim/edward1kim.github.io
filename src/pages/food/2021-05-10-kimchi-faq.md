I've made kimchi by myself quite a few times and have messed up every single time. In the end, they always ended up very good. Hell, I made kimchi this past weekend and it's so damn salty. So I'll address some FAQs I imagine people that also make kimchi and are anxious about their fermentations below.

*How salty should my kimchi be?*

Okay, this is where I make a lot of my mistakes: the salting. You have to salt your kimchi, preferably with big Korean sea salt, between every layer. There should be a higher concentration of salt at the base/stem than the leaves. This is where most of the water is stored and that's where the salt needs to be.

However, a big consequence of this is that your leaves get salty. I've never reached the point where my cabbage was ready for the next step without being absurdly salty. This is where you must taste your cabbage. First, the cabbage must pass that 90 degree bend test. Then, taste the cabbage and if you think it's too salty, it is too salty. One thing people forget is that you're adding more sodium to the ferment through fish sauce and whatever else. If it's already too salty to begin with, then it'll be too salty to eat. 

Leave it in a tub of water and check every 30 minutes til the leaves taste good. Then you can go forward with draining and finally making your kimchi.

*Some of my cabbages are saltier than the other cabbages. What do I do?*

Well first, to prevent this, you have to flip your kimchi around, especially if they're stacke on top of each other. The salt will draw out water and salty water will pool at the bottom. The kimchi at the bottom will be crazy salt unlike the stuff on top. A liquid brine should help get an even salting, but that requires all cabbages to be at the bottom.

However, if some of your cabbages are saltier than the other and you're past this... I'd just go ahead. You can try to single out the salty cabbages and let it sit in some water til it's better, but you're extending your kimchi time by at least an hour and most probably 2 hours. I say if it's not absurdly salty, just go ahead. Maybe you can cut down on the amount of fish sauce, but honestly, the more of ferments, the salt will balance out. It's just a waiting game.

*After making my kimchi it's salty! What do I do?*

I know all these questions are about salty kimchi... This is because my salty kimchi I made is on my mind. Basically, to solve this is just to wait. Maybe you can add some water, maybe you can add some korean raddish/daikon, but overall, the fermentation will balance everything out. Just wait.

Interestingly my kimchi was fine when I made it but became salty after 24 hours out. I've noticed that the fish sauce from the kimchi paste ends up separating out as it ferments. You usually can mix it back together by pressing your kimchi down. For me, the fish sauce rose to the top, so the kimchi was very salty on top. Just mix and wait.

*How can I make my kimchi tastier?*

Great question! First thing is to use a broth/stock in your paste/marinade instead of water. I got this from a video about a kimchi master. Some good ones things to put in that stock is: dried anchovies, onion, green onion, ginger, tomato, apple, kombu, other spices. This fortifies the flavors. The outright taste might not be present, but as it ferments, it gives to a more complex flavor. Trust me on this.

Other than that, get great ingredients. The main thing is gochugaru. You want amazing, spicy, bright red gochugaru. From Korea. That last part might not be possible unless you go to a Korean market in Seoul. 

*Can I make my kimchi vegan?*

Yeah, I'll be honest with you though, it might not taste great at first. It's just missing a lot of oomph. But I remember I made vegan kimchi for a vegetarian I knew. I tasted it and it was so bland that I never gave it to him and let it sit in my fridge for 2 months. At this point, I've exhausted my kimchi and finally opened my stash of trash vegan kimchi. The fermentation, untouched that whole time, was wild. It had a fizzy quality to it, and the flavor was full. It was one of the best kimchis I've made, interestingly. 

*My kimchi is so watery. What do I do?*

This is easy. Put it in the fridge. Kimchi out in the open will be pretty active, and the CO2 expelled from the fermentation will cause the liquid to separate out (I think, this is all a guess). I've noticed that putting it in the fridge either makes the kimchi suck up all the liquid, or the paste starts to thicken up more and it isn't as liquidy. 

I personally think that a longer ferment in the fridge is the way to go. So instead of leaving your kimchi out til it tastes good and sour, I'd just leave it out for 24-36 hours to kickstart the ferment and then put it in the fridge. It'll be perfect in 2-3 weeks. 

*Other than the cabbage, what's your favorite thing to put in the kimchi?*

Along with the napa cabbage, I recomend putting in thinly sliced carrots and daikon/radish. You will not regret it. It has such a delicious, refreshing bite that is balanced with spice, sour, and sweet.
