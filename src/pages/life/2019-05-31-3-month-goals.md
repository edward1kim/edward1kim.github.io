Every three months starting in January, I make a list of goals. It's an initiative I started this year instead of making my ritualistic New Years' Resolutions, of which I never truly follow through on. Since these goals are more short term, it's easier to keep myself accountable. A lot of this is inspired by *Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverence* by Dr. Angela Duckworth. One early chapter of the book talks about goal making and how you should have a high-level goal that guides your life and smaller, step-wise goals to get there. 

For me, I did this a bit backwards: I started off January to March with a ton of goals off the top of my head while going through Senior Design, a CS course, and a random film course. Even worse, I didn't have a high-level goal to focus on. There was no way I would accomplish it all. Look at them!

**January to March Goals:**  
1. Lose 10 pounds  
2. Work out 5 times per week  
3. Get into daily journaling  
4. Go beyond EECS 280/203 and learn more about Computer Science  
5. Get interesting, scalable side hustle  
6. Run 75 miles total

The only one I accomplished was the last oneâ€”and I'm very proud of that! But in my next set of goals, I decided to cut down the amount and be more focused. However, I do not have a high-level goal in mind still. 

**April to June Goals:**  
1. Run 100 miles total  
2. Learn Rust (read through the entire book)  
3. Learn Korean

Overall, I'm a bit behind on all my goals. But with all this trial and error, I will get to a better idea of what kind of story I want to build with all these goals and ultimately where I want to put in my time and effort as I enter adulthood. 

Right now, it's getting into the habit of writing down goals and working towards it when I can, even if I don't accomplish it all.
