Thank you to all the friends who wished me a happy birthday. I keep my birthday pretty low key because I like spending my birthday like most other days, ending with a quick celebration with family. But every year, my friends still remember even after I tried to erase its existence from the web. 

Those two words repeated again and again by friends and family have made me a happier person today. Love you all.
