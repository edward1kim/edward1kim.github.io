Unfortunately, due to some circumstances, we gave our kittens back to the rescue. They've already gotten adopted out, and I hope they're doing well. I've been so incredibly sad this past week because of this. I learned a lot about myself from the moment we got them to now, and even in the short time, I'm surprised how impactful the three kittens were in my life.
