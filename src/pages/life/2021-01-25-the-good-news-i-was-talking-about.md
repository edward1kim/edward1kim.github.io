I got promoted!

At first, I wanted to keep it low key until it was officially offical at work, but then I saw another associate at Capital One announce it on LinkedIn, and with all LinkedIn posts, it starts with some anecdote about goal setting or struggle or entrepreneurship and link back to the actual process. It feels like the clickbait on Linkedin is the antithesis of clickbait everywhere else: short and catching. Anyway, this post. He started talking about how he had a sticky note of his goals to get promoted end of year, how he had it stuck on his monitor since last March, a constant reminder of what he was working for, yadda yadda. And then of course, he finishes the post by saying he achieved everything he wanted to achieve!

Can't say that's the same situation for me. This promotion came as a complete surprise, and talking about it more with another senior engineer, I honestly have no idea why I got promoted. But we take those, no matter the circumstances.

So I'm hyped, I'm ready, a little scared of what more responsibility will look like because I have a pretty nice work-life balance, but what can ya do, I can't *not* take the promotion, right?
