<p><strong>7. Day trip to NOVA in March</strong></p>
<p>Right before the quarantine hit officially in mid-March, I took a trip up to Arlington first to see my friend Danielle, who I have not caught up with in years. I got there a bit early and went to Philz - apparently some well known chain in the bay - the coffee was one of the worst I've ever had. Danielle and I got some pretty awesome sushi, and she used a guest pass for me at her climbing gym. Then, I met up with Nolan (a ChE bro) for dinner. Good laughs and good time. Then I met up with my friend Esther, who was visiting her other friends in the DC area coincidentally. I drove back that same night. This is a top moment because I ended up catching up with 3 friends from 3 different crowds of my life. Plus, it was a fantastically sunny day.</p>
<p><strong>6. Visiting Michigan in February, April, July, and November-December</strong></p>
<p>In February, I came back to see my girlfriend and family. April was the beginning of quarantine, and I made the drive to NYC to pick up my sister and then hustled over to Michigan the next day. That whole month, my family was just stuck inside with lock down; we were all getting cabin fever by the end of the month. In July, I came back again by myself to take care of things at home (cooking, cleaning, shopping, errands, etc.) to support my busy parents as they pivoted to curbside. November to December was the holidays, which means more time as a family to close out the year. In normal times, I wouldn't have been able to see my family as much as I have this year, and I'm very thankful for that. </p>
<p><strong>5. Breaking my lease and signing to a new apartment</strong></p>
<p>Signing to an apartment in Richmond completely blind was a mistake. The mold and all the other issues at my first apartment was always a downer, enough that I paid the extra fees to get out of it 6 months in. Then I signed a new apartment, the best apartment with a very nice open kitchen, lots of counterspace, in-unit washer/dryer, everything new. I remember signing the lease to this new place, walking 5 minutes down the street to a brewery, and toasting my new place to myself. I'm a bit sad that I won't be living there anymore after this year.</p>
<p><strong>4. Weekend coffee time at Blanchards</strong></p>
<p>There's this amazing coffee shop in Richmond called Blanchards my friend showed me. I almost exclusively buy their coffee beans for my homebrewing now. I used to go there every weekend in January to reflect and enjoy coffee. Very medatative, and though shortlived, I will always remember those Saturday mornings with nostalgic fondness.</p>
<p><strong>3. CODA graduation</strong></p>
<p>I loved cheering and being loud with my cohort, who I was with every workday for 6 months straight. It was also my last bit before I entered actual software engineering. It was an extremely bittersweet day. </p>
<p><strong>2. Moving in with my girlfriend</strong></p>
<p>After more than a year of long distance, my girlfriend moved to Richmond, and after a bit of time, we realized we should just move in together. So that happened. We were reunited at the best time: There was a huge exodus of my friends to everywhere other than Richmond and I would have been all by myself if not for her. It's been great so far.</p>
<p><strong>1. Atelier Crenn with Jonathan</strong></p>
<p>And to top the list, just like last year's top moment, my meal at Atelier Crenn with my food homie Jonathan was the best moment of 2020. When we scored this reservation, I was excited. When Crenn messaged Jonathan if we wanted to get upgraded to the Chef's Table experience, where we're eating in the kitchen and able to talk to all the chefs, I was speechless. Over MLK weekend, I had to travel from Richmond to Philly, sprint over to the other side of the airport, and just make my last leg to San Francisco. If I had any delays, I would have missed the dinner for that night and would have cried. But life was gracious and everything worked out. I played a lot of smash, met up with my old roommate, cooked with Jonathan, and had a unstoppable time. For some reason, a really good meal stands out to me than most experiences, but sitting right next to the chefs as I ate my food, talked with them, joked around, just looked at the BEAUTY of a pastry room they had... I don't think I'll ever have something like that again. And that makes me happy and sad at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Some Quick Reflections</strong></p>
<p>I wonder how many times I'll hear/read the words "Fuck 2020" or "We survived 2020!" or "Hindsight 2020" in the next few days. I always took the end of the year and the start of a new one as a time of extreme reflection. Not to be too cliche, but the New Year was really about leaving the old and feeling anew. However, this year is hard to forget and to leave behind. I haven't had the best year - I felt like I was just biding my time til the pandemic faded away to history - I was just living, not enjoying, and especially with the Georgia runoff elections in a few days and President Biden starting his term in January, the anxiety of this year feels like it's being carried over. I could usually separate out my personal life from world events, but after all that happened this year, the overload of social media and awareness, of the zoom calls and Facebook video chats, catching up and losing touch with friends, fire in the trees, hearts, and buildings, I don't think I can ignore the state of the world anymore to my convenience. I've grown a lot in 2020 and I will be making resolutions as usual. But stepping into 2021 does not feel like a victory as January 1, 2020 did. </p>
<p>But alas, time waits for no one and it will continue ticking ahead to who knows what. My biggest hope is that my loved ones stay safe and healthy. I'm not sure who reads this but if you and I haven't talked in a bit, I'd love to catch up just to know that you're okay. Thank you for the great memories. Hopefully I can get a more comprehensive reflection of the year and who I am as I chew on my thoughts more. Until the next post, which I'm trying to do one daily, Happy New Year!</p></div></main></div><footer><h5 class="footerDetails">© <!-- -->2021<!-- --> Edward Kim, Built with<!-- --> <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a></h5></footer></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/life/2020-12-31-top-moments-of-2020/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-9e9c796164da25fa8bfb.js"],"app":["/app-85793e9a5799fd07ff2d.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-ff835df495dcd24cb4e4.js"],"component---src-pages-about-js":["/component---src-pages-about-js-3007cdf55d2cb8586dc9.js"],"component---src-templates-post-js":["/component---src-templates-post-js-d7fb7b25639d6a586170.js"],"component---src-templates-post-lists-js":["/component---src-templates-post-lists-js-e552e98a61bc3e834f1a.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/polyfill-9e9c796164da25fa8bfb.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/component---src-templates-post-js-d7fb7b25639d6a586170.js" async=""></script><script src="/5e7aa890d617a996ca84ef26ab1818ccf4e3fbb3-39be6bea60fa2a4d2b01.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-85793e9a5799fd07ff2d.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-83e11af5cf111be5ad89.js" async=""></script><script src="/styles-bc72ca78f9bad9fb1f45.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-4eb723a6b6595903ac7b.js" async=""></script></body></html>
