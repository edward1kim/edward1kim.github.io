I wasn't very convinced by these financial organizer apps like Mint, which basically does everything my sheet spits out and more, nor comfortable with these companies analyzing my habits neither. Doing all this tracking myself also let me bucket purchases to my preferences. I didn't have to deal with how I bought beer at the grocery store but that was grouped within groceries in an app when really it's a split between alcohol and groceries (which I make a point to separate).</p>
<p>Any transaction made on my credit cards, cash, and Venmo would get recorded onto this sheet. At this moment, I have over 800 purchases of some kind, and with data starting from August 2019, I'd like to share some of my findings.</p>
<p>I'll admit here that with my salary I am fortunate to have more money than I know what to do with. I'm not looking very far ahead with salary growth, but things are pretty comfortable right now. And as a result, I've never taken the time to assess my habits (until now I guess) and adjust how I spend my money. But let's just get to the good stuff.</p>
<p>(Note: I've overlayed a moving average for the bar graphs. A moving average is just the average of values up to that point. I used this to see if I'm overspending or underspending relative to my "usual". And it also lets me see trends)</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's start with my total spend per month:</p>
<p><img src="/images/spending-charts/monthly-spend.jpg" alt="total spend per month"></p>
<p>I've left out August 2019 in my moving average calculation because I moved out to Richmond in the middle of the month and didn't end up spending a lot of money then. It's what Malcolm Gladwell would call an outlier. I've colored the charts relative to my moving average, where close to the average meant yellow, above average spending was red, and below average spending was green. I'll summarize the story behind this chart in bullets.</p>
<ul>
<li>The slightly higher spend in November 2019 was due to Jonathan and I scoring a reservation at Atelier Crenn, by far one of the best experiences in my life</li>
<li>The insane spike in February 2020 was because I was sick of the black mold in my apartment and decided to end my lease early and move out to a better apartment, ended up paying double rent for a month + fees</li>
<li>March 2020 was the start of quarantine/WFH, resulting in a way lower spend</li>
<li>In April 2020, my sister and I decided to drive back to Michigan together since my parents had to close their business due to covid precautions, my parents paid for our food/groceries/necessities while we were there. We drove back to our homes at the end of the month</li>
<li>I drove back to Michigan in July 2020 to support my parents since they opened up work again and were absolutely slammed, weirdly my spend did not drastically decrease like in April</li>
<li>My girlfriend moved to Richmond in August 2020 so I had to spend more money as a flex</li>
<li>I've been back in Michigan for the holidays for November and December 2020, spending is very low relative to the average</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Next I had to look at my food spending.</p>
<p><img src="/images/spending-charts/eating-out-vs-groceries.jpg" alt="eating out vs groceries"></p>
<p>The chart was very eye opening really. I don't spend a lot of money at once for food, but I do go to the grocery store 3-4 times a week and eat out once or twice a week at my worst times. It really adds up. My bullets below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Of course as I'm adjusting to my independence, I'm eating out more at August 2019 but end up spending more on groceries by October 2019</li>
<li>The eating out spike in November 2019 is solely due to getting that reservation at Atelier Crenn, I have zero regrets</li>
<li>From December 2019 to April 2020, I am eating out surprisingly a lot. I was traveling during this period though, between Michigan, NYC, San Francisco, Washington DC, which contributed a good portion to the increase</li>
<li>The grocery spike in May 2020 is from my CSA subscription, and that subscription carried over to the next few months</li>
<li>However, in May 2020 and a few months after, I am still eating out more and more. The CSA didn't provide me a lot of food I liked, just a bit more variety for me to play with</li>
<li>August-October 2020, my girlfriend and I made up for our 1+ year LDR with lots of eating out and lots of home cooking, what can I say</li>
<li>November and December 2020, I am home in Michigan where my parents graciously cover food costs so I spend nearly nothing</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Lastly, I charted my spending buckets. I did one with everything and one with everything except rent contributions.</p>
<p><img src="/images/spending-charts/spend-split.jpg" alt="total spend percentages">  </p>
<p><img src="/images/spending-charts/spend-split-minus-rent.jpg" alt="total spend minus rent percentages">  </p>
<p>Pretty short analysis here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rent is over half my spending (<em>not</em> my post-tax income), makes me consider getting property than continue renting</li>
<li>After Rent, my top 3 are Food, Things (meaning objects I buy for myself), and Groceries. I'm surprised Things is pretty high up... I have spent a lot of money during quarantine just to feel something so I guess it makes sense</li>
<li>Gifting is my next highest spend, I really do love giving gifts to people, but I also hate expectations of gifts on birthdays </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>So that's basically been my day. Some changes I want to make is to (of course) spend less, and a good place to tackle that is to stop eating out as much (maybe once a week at most) and stop buying things I don't need. It's a pandemic; I shouldn't be indulging. I do want to keep giving gifts, but that's usually off a whim or if I see something that reminds me of someone. One thing I want to commit more to next year is donating to different causes I care about. Like I said, I have more money than I know what to do with, and dedicating however much I can to help the homeless, children, environment, small businesses is one step closer to my ideal world.</p>
<p>I'm happy that I kept up this logging for all these months, even if it was a pain in the ass. I unknowingly gathered a decent amount of data about myself. It's crazy that after making a few of these charts, you can make a pretty good guess at what kind of person I am. Pretty neat in my hands, scary in a company's database.</p></div></main></div><footer><h5 classNae="footerDetails">© <!-- -->2021<!-- --> Edward Kim, Built with<!-- --> <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a></h5></footer></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/life/2020-12-28-my-spending-trends/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-9e9c796164da25fa8bfb.js"],"app":["/app-dd393d78d8098383f3b5.js"],"component---src-pages-about-js":["/component---src-pages-about-js-a72ca751804dd8454d72.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-00278b246d4dbb8790bf.js"],"component---src-templates-post-js":["/component---src-templates-post-js-27775870f30f322c2407.js"],"component---src-templates-post-lists-js":["/component---src-templates-post-lists-js-4c6b8e45318a5e5c872c.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/polyfill-9e9c796164da25fa8bfb.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/component---src-templates-post-js-27775870f30f322c2407.js" async=""></script><script src="/commons-9aaf2ec6d857a38f30e0.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-dd393d78d8098383f3b5.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-83e11af5cf111be5ad89.js" async=""></script><script src="/styles-bc72ca78f9bad9fb1f45.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-2eff9db88669ab49d242.js" async=""></script></body></html>
